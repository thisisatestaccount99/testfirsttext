Introduction
What is a case interview?
If you are reading this book, you are likely preparing for an
upcoming consulting case interview. Whether your case interview
is months away or even tomorrow, this book is designed to teach
you how to confidently and effectively master case interviews in a
clear, concise, and direct way.
Why do consulting companies give case interviews to their
candidates? The primary reason is that case interviews are the most
effective way to help companies determine if a candidate will be
successful at the consulting job. During a case interview, candidates
will be asked to solve broad business problems that real consultants
solve in the real world. For example, should a laptop manufacturer
enter the tablet market? How should a hotel price its different
rooms? Should a large, declining pharmaceutical company acquire
a smaller, more innovative healthcare startup? These broad
business problems that real consultants spend months solving, you
will solve in a 30 minute to one hour case interview.
Case interviews test for problem solving skills, the ability to
communicate clearly and effectively, business acumen, and
enthusiasm for consulting all at once. There are so many different
capabilities and qualities that interviewers are looking for. Case
interviews also give you a taste of what it is like to be a consultant.
If you enjoy doing case interviews, there is a high chance that you
will also enjoy the consulting job.
A typical McKinsey, Bain, or BCG first-round interview is
comprised of two back-to-back case interviews while a final-round
may have two to four case interviews. To get a job offer from a top
consulting firm, you will need to nail four to six case interviews
each time.
The purpose of this book

5

When I was interviewing for consulting, I read nearly every single
case interview book on the market. For these books, I felt that only
20% of the content had valuable information while the other 80%
was filled with common sense suggestions, anecdotal stories, or
long rambling narratives. Even though these books had 250+ pages,
I felt they were missing a lot of the precise details that separate a
good case interview candidate from an exceptional one. I would
spend a week reading a case interview book, only to finish with
knowledge that I could have learned in a single day, while also
missing the details needed to be exceptional.
I wanted this book to be different.
My aspiration for writing this book is to give you everything you
need to know to master case interviews in the shortest amount of
time possible. To do this, I cut out all of the useless fluff and
narratives that other books sell you and try to keep my prose as
direct, clear, and concise as possible. I will tell you exactly what you
need to do and say, what the interviewer is looking for, and how to
differentiate yourself from the thousands of other candidates every
single step of the way.
With that said, reading this book by itself will not make you a case
interview master. To achieve full mastery, you will need to spend
many more hours practicing mock case interviews. There is no book
that can teach you everything that you learn from doing practice
case interviews. Practice and discipline will get you multiple
consulting job offers.
This book will answer a variety of different questions that
you may have:
What should I expect during a case interview?
What should I do and say during each part of the case
interview?
What is the interviewer looking for in each part of the
case interview?
6

What business knowledge do I need to know?
What kinds of math should I be able to do?
What frameworks do I need to memorize?
How do I differentiate myself from the thousands of other
candidates?
How do I do practice case interviews to get better?
Who am I?
By the time I had finished interviewing for consulting firms, I had
done and given 200+ practice cases and interviewed at over ten
different consulting firms. My hard work paid off, as I received
multiple offers and ended up signing with a top (McKinsey, Bain,
BCG) global consulting firm. In my first few years of work, I led
case interview workshops across schools in the US. I worked with
high-potential candidates, and helped many of them receive job
offers.
This book is a compilation of all of the hundreds of hours of case
interview experience I have accumulated. I hope that this book will
help you receive your dream job offer.
Let’s get started.

I. The Different Parts and Progression of a Case
Interview
With enough practice, case interviews can be straight forward and
even repetitive. Every single case roughly follows this one
particular sequence. It’s all about knowing what to expect during
each part of the case interview and being prepared for each part.
The rest of the book is organized into chapters by these different
parts of a case interview. Each chapter will discuss the following:
what happens during each part of the case interview, what the
interviewer is looking for, exactly what you should be doing, and
how to differentiate yourself from the thousands of other
candidates out there that are interviewing for the same position.
How the case interview will proceed
Interviewer: Presents background information on the case, what
the problem is, and what the objective or objectives are
(II. Understanding the Case Background Information)
You: Synthesize major points of the case background information
and verify objectives
(III. Verifying Objectives)
You: Request time to structure thoughts into a framework
(IV. Developing a Structured Framework)
***Silence for two to three minutes
(V. Handling the Moment of Silence)
You: Present framework to interviewer
(VI. Presenting your Framework)
You + Interviewer: Either the interviewer will review your
framework and suggest an area to start the case OR you will be
expected to suggest an area to start the case
(VII. Starting the Case)
8

You + Interviewer: Solving quantitative problems
(VIII. Solving Quantitative Problems)
You + Interviewer: Solving qualitative questions on business
judgement/intuition
(IX. Answering Qualitative Business Questions)
You + Interviewer: The interviewer will ask or prompt you for a
summary and recommendation
(X. Delivering a Conclusion)
What else to expect during a case interview
For the majority of the case interview, both you and the interviewer
will be working together to reach the ultimate answer. Think of the
case interview as a flowing discussion of ideas and opinions. The
case interview should not sound like a Q&A session. Even for the
sections above that are not marked “You + Interviewer”, you
should still be engaged with the interviewer, asking questions,
aligning on the path forward, and asking for input.
There will be times during the case interview when the interviewer
will be driving the case and guiding you on what direction the case
interview should proceed. They will be asking you questions to
answer and giving you information along the way. Other times,
you will be driving and leading the case interview. You will be
expected to ask the interviewer for information and suggest areas to
look into or analyze.
During the case interview, don’t be surprised if the interviewer
gives you handouts with charts, graphs, tables, or other forms of
data. They are testing for your ability to interpret and analyze data,
a critical capability for any consultant.
Finally, do not bring a calculator, reference books, or notes to the
case interview. All math that you do will be calculated by hand,
and the interviewer will not let you refer to external materials. The
only notes that you should have are the ones that you are taking
9

during the case interview.
To give you a better idea of what a case interview actually sounds
like, I am including a full case interview dialogue below. While
reading the dialogue, pay close attention to how collaborative and
discussion-based the interview is.
Example of a full case interview dialogue
Interviewer: Our client is Burger Guys, a fast food burger
restaurant that sells hamburgers, cheeseburgers, and french fries.
The CEO of the restaurant has hired us because they have been
losing money over the past year. He wants to know why Burger
Guys is losing money, and what they should do about it.
Candidate: Great. To clarify, when you say that “Burger Guys is
losing money” do you mean that profits have gone down? Or do
you mean profitability has gone down?
Interviewer: Profits have gone down. Thanks for catching that.
Candidate: One other follow-up question, is Burger Guys a single
restaurant? Or is it a chain with multiple locations?
Interviewer: Burger Guys is a single restaurant.
Candidate: Thanks. To summarize, our client is Burger Guys, a fast
food burger restaurant that has experienced declining profits over
the past year. The objectives of this case are to: 1) determine why
Burger Guys is losing money, and 2) determine what Burger Guys
should do to improve profits. Is my understanding correct?
Interviewer: Yes, it is.
Candidate: Would you mind if I took a moment to structure my
thoughts and develop a framework that we can talk through to
tackle the objectives?
Interviewer: Sure. That sounds great.

10

Candidate: Thanks.
***Silence for two to three minutes
Candidate: I am just about wrapping up my thoughts.
Interviewer: Take your time.
Candidate: In order to approach this problem, I would like to look
into four areas.
First, I’d like to look at profit, and break it down into revenue and
costs. I would like to look into how revenue and costs have changed
over the past few years. Depending on which is most responsible
for the decline in profits, I would like to further break down
revenue (into quantity and price) and costs (into fixed costs and
variable costs) to identify the specific drivers causing the decline in
profits.
Second, I’d like to look into the different customer segments. Have
customer preferences changed during this time period? Do
customers perceive or view our company differently than before?
Third, I’d like to look into the competitive landscape of the fast food
burger market. Have new competitors entered the market? Are
competitors doing something different than what they were
previously doing?
Fourth, I’d like to look into the fast food burger market itself. Have
profits gone down for the fast food burger market overall? Are
there new government regulations affecting burger production or
selling? Are there new technologies or practices that are disrupting
the fast food burger market?
Interviewer: That sounds good. I think all of the points you
mentioned are relevant and worth looking into. Where would you
like to start?
Candidate: I’d like to start with the first area, profit. I want to
identify exactly why profits have gone done. After that, we can look
11

into qualitatively why this is happening, and think through
strategies and actions to address the decline in profits.
Interviewer: That makes sense. Let’s proceed.
Candidate: Let’s start with costs. Perhaps costs have gone up,
which would cut into profits. Do we have any information on costs?
Interviewer: We don’t have much information on costs. We believe
that costs have not changed much in the past few years.
Candidate: Ok, since costs have roughly stayed the same, and
profits have declined, that means revenue must have decreased. Do
we have information on how quantity of food sold has changed? Or
if we have changed price?
Interviewer: We have not changed price, but we have seen a
decline in quantity sold.
Candidate: I know that we sell three different food items:
hamburgers, cheeseburgers, and french fries. Is there a particular
food item that has declined significantly in quantity sold?
Interviewer: We are seeing the steepest decline in hamburgers and
cheeseburgers.
Candidate: Interesting. We have identified the driver behind the
decline in profits. We are selling fewer hamburgers and
cheeseburgers. The next step here is to look into why, qualitatively,
are we selling fewer quantities of these food items? I think it would
make sense to move onto the second area of my framework,
customer segments. Do we have any information on what the
different customer segments are, have their preferences changed
over time, or if they view our company differently than before?
Interviewer: We actually do a customer food preference survey
every year to understand customer demands and trends on various
food items. Our survey produced the following information. What
insights are you able to draw from this?
12

eating?

Candidate: Looking at this chart, I need to calculate the percentage
of respondents that are most interested in eating each type of food
since the survey totals for the two years aren’t the same. Doing this,
we see that customer preferences for burgers has gone down from
48% to 45%. Preferences for pizza have gone up from 28% to 35%.
Preferences for sandwiches have gone down from 16% to 15% and
the “Other” category has gone down from 8% to 5%. Therefore, I
think that the decrease in sales of burgers is caused by a shift in
customer preference towards eating pizza.
Interviewer: I agree with that interpretation. Let’s say that
management is interested in opening up a fast food pizza
restaurant to take advantage of this change in customer preference.
The first step in evaluating this is to determine the market size of
pizzas. How would you go about calculating this?
Candidate: Before I start, I am assuming that we are defining the
market as people in the US? Or is our fast food restaurant located in
a different country?
Interviewer: Yes, let’s go with the US.
Candidate: Would you mind if I took a minute to develop a
structure for calculating this?
Interviewer: Of course, go ahead.
13

***Roughly a minute of silence
Candidate: In order to calculate the market size of pizzas in the US,
I will first start with the US population. I will then segment the
population by age group because different age groups have
different levels of preference for eating pizza. Next, I will estimate
the percentage of people in each age group that eat pizza. Once I
have done this, I will estimate the frequency in which people eat
pizza. This will give me the number of pizzas consumed in a year,
and I will then multiply number of pizzas consumed with price to
get the market size. How does that sound?
Interviewer: That sounds like a good approach. Let’s proceed.
Candidate: Great. I will start off with the US population being
320M. I will then divide the population into four different age
groups: (0-20), (20-40), (40-60), (60-80). This means each age group
has 80M people.
Interviewer: What underlying assumptions are you making here?
Candidate: This assumes human life expectancy is 80 years, and I
have assumed there is an even distribution of ages across the
population. Does that seem reasonable?
Interviewer: Yes, that seems reasonable. I just wanted to make sure
I caught all of your implicit assumptions.
Candidate: Looking at the (0-20) age group, I will assume a fairly
high percentage eat pizza, since pizza seems to be very popular
with kids and young adults. Let’s assume 50% will eat pizza. This
gives us 40M pizza consumers in this segment.
For the (20-40) age group, I think the percentage that eat pizza will
be lower since this age group will be more concerned with their
health and eating right. Let’s assume 30% will eat pizza. This gives
us 24M pizza consumers in this segment.
For the (40-60) age group, I would imagine that the percentage of
14

people that eat pizza here is even lower. As people get older, I don’t
think their bodies will be able to process and digest pizza as easily
as they could when they were younger. Let’s assume 20% eat pizza.
This gives us 16M pizza consumers in this segment.
Finally, for the (60-80) age group, I would imagine very few people
eat pizza for similar reasons. Let’s assume 10%. This gives us 8M
pizza consumers in this segment.
Adding all of these up, we get 88M pizza consumers.
Interviewer: Does this number seem reasonable to you?
Candidate: I have assumed that the US has 320M people. I
calculated that 88M people eat pizza, which would mean roughly a
little more 25% of the population eats pizza. This number seems
reasonable to me, what do you think?
Interviewer: I agree that the number seems reasonable, perhaps a
little on the low side. Let’s say that 90M people eat pizza to make
the math a bit simpler.
Candidate: Great. Next, I need to estimate the frequency at which
these 90M people eat pizza. Based on my personal experiences
eating pizza, people will consume 2-3 slices or a quarter of a pizza,
every meal. Let’s say that they eat pizza once a week, which would
give us roughly 52 meals times a quarter of a pizza each meal, or 13
pizzas a year.
Multiplying 13 pizzas a year with 90M people gives us 1.17B pizzas.
Interviewer: Let’s say 1.2B pizzas consumed a year, and let’s
assume the average pizza costs $15.
Candidate: Great. So, 1.2B pizzas times $15 gives us a market size
of $18B. In order to determine if this is a large market size, I’d like
to compare it to the burger market size. Do we have that
information?
Interviewer: Let’s say that the burger market size is $30B.
15

Candidate: Wow. That means that the pizza market is much
smaller than the burger market, about 60% of its size. My
preliminary conclusion is that we should not enter the pizza market
since it is a relatively small market. To further validate this, I’d like
to compare the average profit margin in the burger market with
that of the pizza market. Do we have that information?
Interviewer: Let’s say that profit margins in the burger market are
3% and profit margins in the pizza market are 9%.
Candidate: This changes my conclusion. Although the pizza market
is only 60% the size of the burger market, the profit margins are
three times that of the burger market. Therefore, I think that the
pizza market would be an attractive market to enter.
Interviewer: I agree with your interpretation of this data. What if I
told you that the leading pizza restaurant in the city that Burger
Guys is in has 10% market share. What conclusions can you draw?
Candidate: If the market leader has 10% market share, that implies
that the market is fairly fragmented. This means that there are low
barriers to entry.
Interviewer: What are some examples of barriers to entry that you
can think of?
Candidate: We can think of barriers to entry as both economic
barriers to entry and non-economic barriers to entry. Examples of
economic barriers to entry would be: the capital required to start a
pizza restaurant, economies of scale to have cost advantages, and
distribution channels and infrastructure needed for pizza delivery.
Examples of non-economic barriers to entry include: brand name in
the pizza market, knowledge/expertise to make superior pizza, and
restaurant differentiation from the other pizza restaurants in the
market.
Interviewer: Let’s say that the CEO walks in and wants an update
and preliminary recommendation on what you have been working
16

on so far. What do you say?
Candidate: Burger Guys has been experiencing a decline in profits
because the quantity of burgers sold has decreased. This is caused
by a change in customer preference towards consuming pizza. To
address this, I recommend that we enter into the pizza market for
the following three reasons.
One, customer food preferences are shifting from burgers to pizza.
Our recent survey found that eating preferences for burgers has
declined from 48% to 45% in the past year, while eating preferences
for pizzas has increased from 28% to 35%.
Two, the pizza market is more attractive than the burger market.
Although the pizza market is only $18B, 60% of the size of the
burger market, the average profit margins are three times that of
the burger market, 9% compared to 3%.
Three, the market is fairly fragmented, with the top player only
having 10% of the market share. This implies that there are low
barriers to entry for Burger Guys to enter the market.
For these three reasons, I recommend that we consider entering the
pizza market. For next steps, I’d like to look into two things. One,
I’d like to look at Burger Guys’ capabilities to determine if we are
capable of entering the pizza market. This would include looking
into synergies between running a fast food burger restaurant and a
pizza restaurant. Two, I’d like to do a revenue and cost analysis to
determine if we would be profitable if we entered the pizza market.
Interviewer: Great, thanks. That concludes the case interview.

II. Understanding the Case Background Information
The case begins with the interviewer giving you the case
background information and objective.
Some cases may have a very small amount of background
information. In this instance, every single thing that the interviewer
says may be important. Other cases may have a large amount of
background information that will require you to make a judgement
call on which pieces of information are important and which pieces
are less important.
The main objectives for you are to:
1. Understand the situation of the case
2. Determine what the goals or objectives of the case are
3. Ask clarifying questions
During this part of the case interview, the interviewer is not
specifically evaluating you on a certain set of criteria since the
interviewer will be doing most of the talking. However, you are still
leaving an impression on the interviewer based on the questions
you ask. Therefore, ensure that you are:
NOT asking irrelevant questions about the case
NOT asking the interviewer to repeat a tremendous
amount of information
NOT interrupting the interviewer too much
The first objective, understanding the situation, requires that you
have an understanding of the various pieces of information that the
interviewer disclose to you. Examples of information that are likely
important include:
What is the name of the company/client that we are
18

trying to help?
What do they do or make?
How are they doing in the market?
What major actions has the company/client done
recently?
How is the market that they are in doing?
What is the competitive landscape like?
What have competitors been doing?
The second objective, determining the goals of the case, dictates
what you will be doing for the rest of the case interview. Cases may
have a single objective or multiple ones. Examples of common
objectives are:
Determine whether or not the company/client should
enter a new market
Determine whether or not the company/client should
acquire another company
Determine why the company/client is losing revenue
Determine why the company/client
experiencing increasing costs

has

been

Determine why the profitability of the company/client
has been decreasing
Determine what to do about a new competitor entering
the market
The third objective requires that you ask clarifying questions when
needed. There may be a particular term that you are not familiar
with, or you may need the interviewer to repeat a piece of
19

information.
One question that comes up when I am giving mock interviews is
whether or not it is okay to interrupt the interviewer with questions
when they are giving you the case background information. My
short answer to that question is that if it is an important question
that will hinder your understanding for the rest of the case
background information, go ahead and politely interrupt the
interviewer to ask your question. It is better to ask the interviewer
to repeat or explain one thing, rather than having to repeat the
entire case background information because you did not
understand a term or concept.
For example, suppose the case interview is about purchasing a
timeshare company, but you have no idea what a timeshare is. If
you don’t know what timeshares are, it will be difficult for you to
understand the rest of the case background. Therefore, it is in your
best interest to understand what timeshares are right away, so that
you can better absorb the information that follows.
For questions that will not hinder your understanding for the rest
of the case background information, you should be able to hold off
on asking those until the interviewer has finished speaking. Once
they have finished talking, you can then ask your clarifying
questions or ask them to repeat a thing or two.
Examples of clarifying questions include:
Did you say that profits have gone down or revenue has
gone down?
You mentioned that the company sold four different
items. What was the fourth one again?
I’m not quite familiar with the term “share of wallet”.
What does that mean?
Is our company based only in the US? Or are they global?

20

Very little evaluation occurs during this part of the case, as the
interviewer is simply presenting you the case background
information. As long as you don’t ask irrelevant questions, ask the
interviewer to repeat too much information, or interrupt the
interviewer too frequently, you will be just fine.
Taking notes during the case interview
During this part of the case interview, you should be taking notes
on what the interviewer is telling you.
I recommend orienting your sheet of paper so that it is landscape
(long side on the bottom). Draw a vertical straight line on the page
so that the left-hand side is roughly one-third of the page and the
right-hand side is roughly two-thirds of the page. From this point
on, use the left-hand side to take notes for the rest of the case. The
right-hand side will have your framework that you will structure
later on.
Any calculations or math that you do should be done on a separate
sheet of paper. This way, you do not mix calculations with your
framework or notes. As the case goes on, if there are any key
takeaways or important pieces of information that you discover,
make a note of it in your notes column. Doing this will make the
conclusion part of the case interview much easier for you, as you
have recorded all of the key pieces of information in one place.
You are most likely not going to be able to write down every single
thing that your interviewer says. Therefore, it is important that you
are taking notes in a bullet point format. You should not be taking
notes in complete sentences. Feel free to use any shorthand
notation, as long as you can easily recall what you mean later on in
the case. An example of shorthand could be writing down “R↓, C↑”
instead of “revenue has decreased and costs have increased.”
You should be capturing all of the important information your
interviewer is giving you and leaving out minor details that you
could ask for later on in the case if needed.

21

III. Verifying Objectives
You’ve taken some great notes, and if you had any clarifying
questions, you have asked them and had them answered. For this
next part of the case interview, your objectives are to:
1. Synthesize and present the key pieces of information in a
clear, concise, and confident way
2. Verify what the goals or objectives of the case are
This is the part of the case interview where your evaluation begins.
In this part, the interviewer is looking for your:
Ability to synthesize information and identify what is
important
Ability to communicate in a clear, concise, and confident
way
For the first objective, synthesizing key pieces of information, you
can differentiate yourself from other candidates if your recap of the
information is short and sweet.
The most common mistake I see is people reciting back all of the
information they have heard to the interviewer. The interviewer
does not want to listen to an exact playback of what they have just
said to the candidate. They are testing whether the interviewee can
parse out the most important pieces of information from the rest of
the minor details.
Another common mistake I see is interviewees inserting their own
assumptions or conclusions during the recap. The recap should be
strictly factual. You should not be inserting information that the
interviewer has not given you. You can state your assumptions or
conclusions in later parts of the case.
Example: Let’s say that your interviewer gives you the following
information:
22

Our client makes several varieties of sweet jams, such as
strawberry, blueberry, and raspberry, in the US. During the past
winter, a strong blizzard has hit one of the groves where the berries
grow. As a result, our client has lost roughly a quarter of their
berries. Because of this, they are considering planting peanuts in
Mexico so that they can produce peanut butter in addition to sweet
jams. This way, if a strong blizzard hits the US again, our client will
still have peanuts to produce peanut butter. Should they enter the
peanut butter market?
A bad recap:
“Our client makes several varieties of sweet jams, such as
strawberry, blueberry, and raspberry. During the past winter,
a strong blizzard hit one of the groves where the berries grow.
Our client lost roughly a quarter of their berries that they use
for jams. Since this probably caused a decrease in profits, they
are also considering planting peanuts in a different region to
produce peanut butter. The objective is to determine whether
or not they should enter the peanut butter market to increase
profits.”
This recap is bad for a variety of reasons. First, it is not concise. It is
almost as long as the original statement given by the interviewer.
Second, even though the recap is long, it leaves out important
pieces of information (e.g. the client is a US company looking to
expand internationally into Mexico). Third, the recap introduces
some assumptions or conclusions that the interviewer never
mentioned (e.g. decline in profits as a result of the blizzard).
A good recap:
“Our client produces jams in the US. During the past winter,
they have lost a quarter of their berries due to a blizzard.
Because of this, they are considering planting peanuts in
Mexico and entering the peanut butter market. The objective is
to determine whether or not they should enter the peanut
butter market.”
23

This recap is much more concise than the previous one. All of the
important pieces of information are captured, and no
assumptions/conclusions are inserted. The recap is strictly factual.
For the second objective, verifying the goals of the case, it is
important to make sure that you and the interviewer are aligned on
what the goals of the case are. If you and the interviewer have
different ideas of what the objectives are, you will be wasting a lot
of time during the interview asking questions that are not relevant
or doing analysis that is not important to developing a
recommendation. It will be very difficult for you to recover from
this misalignment. Even the best interview candidates in the world
will still verify the objectives with the interviewer because they
know how important it is.
Although this part of the case is simple, it is important to do this
part well. What you say during this part of the case interview sets
the tone for what the interviewer is to expect from you in later
parts. Secondly, if this part of the case interview goes smoothly, you
will feel much more confident and comfortable with the rest of the
case moving forward. You can easily build up momentum and
confidence by doing this part well since this part is not technical or
difficult.

24

IV. Developing a Structured Framework
Developing a structured framework is by far the most difficult part
of the case interview. If you nail down this part, the rest of the case
interview will come much easier to you. Conversely, a weak
framework can set you up to crash and burn later on in the case
interview.
The good news is that you are not expected to come up with a
framework instantaneously. Generally, you are allowed to ask for a
few minutes to gather and structure your thoughts to develop a
framework.
What is a framework? At a high level, a framework is an organized
and structured set of ideas that you can explore and learn more
about in order to help discover the answer and deliver on the
objective of the case. The broad ideas in the framework are referred
to as “buckets”. For the rest of this book, I will use this term. You
should also use the term “buckets”, as you will sound more like a
consultant.
The most generic framework that candidates commonly use is a
four bucket framework consisting of: customer, competition,
product, and company. For example, if the objective of one case
interview is to determine whether or not a company should enter a
new market, we can use this four bucket framework to gather
information that will help us develop and strengthen a
recommendation.
While this framework is useful, we can do better than that. The
framework listed above will not help differentiate yourself from the
other candidates. It is extremely generic and over used.
Criteria for developing an exceptional framework
Before I present my strategy for developing frameworks, let’s
review all of the criteria the case interviewer is looking for in an
exceptional framework:
25

1. All buckets must be relevant to the objective of the case
2. Buckets should not have any overlap with each another
3. There should be three to four buckets (however, some
cases may naturally have only two)
4. The framework is not a generic framework (like the one
listed above)
5. Under each bucket, there are two to three sub-bullets,
which add detail and specifics about what each bucket
means
6. The sub-bullets are all relevant to the objective of the case
7. The sub-bullets do not have any overlap with one another
Looking at the first objective, all buckets should be relevant to the
objective of the case. One common mistake I see among candidates
is that they come in with pre-memorized frameworks. As is often
the case with pre-memorized frameworks, not all of the buckets or
sub-bullets will be relevant to the objective of the case. Presenting a
framework in which not all of the buckets are relevant allows the
interviewer to quickly figure out that you are just leveraging
memorized frameworks and are not truly thinking about the
problem. This is a huge pitfall for the vast majority of candidates.
Example: Let’s say that you are given a case on whether or not
Company A should acquire Company B. If you used the generic
framework: customer, competition, product, and company, several
of these buckets aren’t relevant. For example, is looking at the
products of Company A and Company B the most important thing
to look into? The answer is no. This framework is missing key
topics such as synergies, cost of acquisition, and the attractiveness
of the market Company B is in.
For the second objective, the buckets should not overlap with each
other. What I mean by this is that each bucket must be distinct from
26

all of the other buckets. Buckets that are not distinct and have
overlap with one another show poor structural and organizational
thinking. Structure is a very important characteristic that
interviewers look for.
Example: If two of my buckets are “cost” and “financial
considerations”, then the buckets are not distinct from one another.
One component of “financial considerations” is cost, which I have
as another bucket. The two buckets overlap, and show a messy
organization of ideas.
For the third objective, coming up with only one or two buckets
may show that you are not very good at brainstorming ideas.
Therefore, you should aim to have a minimum of three buckets. On
the flipside, having eight buckets will not earn you extra points
with the interviewer. More likely than not, if you have eight
buckets, a few of your buckets will not be distinct from one another
and overlap. Again, this shows poor structure. The sweet spot is
usually three to four buckets.
I do want to note that there are some case interviews where two
buckets should naturally be used. For example, if the interviewer
asks for the benefits and costs of starting an NBA basketball team,
your buckets should naturally be some version of the words
“benefits” and “costs”. However, just because you are using two
buckets does not mean you cannot further structure and subdivide
these. You can split "benefits" into “long-term benefits” and “shortterm benefits.” You can split "costs" into “economic costs” and
“non-economic costs.”
For the fourth objective, this is the number one mistake that I see
with candidates. The biggest takeaway in this book is to use a
unique framework for each case you are given, NOT a generic one.
I will go over how to do this later on in this chapter.
Candidates come into a case interview having read one or two
popular case interview books. And so, for whatever case they are
given, the framework buckets that they use are some combination
of: customer, competition, product, and company. Again, most
27

candidates are using some variation of this framework. You are not
helping yourself stand out from the rest of the crowd if you use this
framework as well.
For the fifth objective, you should elaborate on what your buckets
mean by adding two to three sub-bullets under each bucket that
you have. For example, just having a bucket of “market” would not
be very interesting on its own. To add detail about what you mean,
you can add sub-bullets such as “market size”, “market growth
rate”, and “average profit margins in the market”. The sub-bullets
specify exactly what pieces of information you want to discuss or
learn more about within a bucket.
For the sixth and seventh objectives, just as your buckets had to be
relevant to the objective of the case and not overlap with one
another, so too do all of your sub-bullets under each bucket.
Looking at the requirements above, it may appear difficult to you to
come up with a perfect framework for each case that you get. Given
the time pressure of only having a few minutes to come up with a
framework, the task is daunting for the majority of candidates.
Memorizing frameworks beforehand will help you come up with a
framework more easily, but those frameworks may not be entirely
relevant to the objective of the case and may be generic. On the
flipside, coming up with a unique framework from scratch each
time would ensure that the framework is relevant to the objective of
the case and be unique, but this is challenging to do in only a few
minutes. What is the solution to this dilemma?
Strategy to tackling frameworks
My solution is a strategy that is somewhere in between these two
approaches. There are definitely things that you must memorize
and be able to recall from the top of your head, but you also get to
do novel, creative thinking throughout the process.
The strategy I recommend for tackling frameworks sounds simple,
but will take time and practice to fully develop and master.
28

Memorize a list of eight different buckets. When you encounter a
case:
Step One: Mentally run through the list of eight buckets and select
the three to four that are the most relevant.
Step Two: Once you select the buckets, brainstorm two to three
sub-bullets for each of the buckets.
That’s it. You only need to memorize eight things.
For step one, you should have these eight buckets fully memorized
by heart. You should be able to wake up in the middle of the night
and immediately recall the eight buckets within ten seconds. This
part is fairly easy.
For step two, this is where you will need to do most of your
thinking and spend the majority of your time mastering the skill.
The two to three sub-bullets should be tailored to the exact case that
you are trying to solve for. They should not be completely
memorized. Why? Because sub-bullets that are relevant for one case
may not be relevant for other cases. How exactly do we come up
with these sub-bullets? The simple answer is that as you do more
and more cases, the sub-bullets will come easier to you as you are
brainstorming and thinking about them.
What are the eight buckets that you need to memorize? They are as
follows:
1. Market attractiveness
2. Competitive landscape
3. Company attractiveness OR company capabilities
4. Customer segmentation and needs
5. Financial considerations
6. Risks and mitigations
29

7. Synergies
8. Create your own bucket
First of all, the names of the buckets are longer than one word.
Instead of using the bucket “market”, we use “market
attractiveness”. Instead of “competition”, we use “competitive
landscape". Although these are common buckets used in
frameworks, we create the illusion of a more unique framework by
adding a slightly longer description to the bucket name.
Second, do not be tied to the exact wording of the bucket names.
For example, look at the third bullet above. If in a case you are
looking into acquiring another company, “company attractiveness”
would be the right bucket name to use. If in another case, you are
looking into entering a market, “company capabilities” would be
the right bucket name to use. You may slightly customize the
naming of the buckets for each case. If you are analyzing the
cellphone market, you could call the bucket “cellphone market
attractiveness” instead of “market attractiveness.” If you are
analyzing a company named Diamond Co., you can call the bucket
“Diamond Co. capabilities” instead of “company capabilities.”
What is important is that you are memorizing the concept of each
bucket. Do not be so tied down to memorizing the exact phrases or
words as long as you remember the concept or theme behind each
bucket.
Understanding the eight buckets
Below, I have provided a description of each of the eight buckets.
The descriptions for each bucket are meant to give you an idea of
what possible sub-bullets could be. Remember that you do not need
to memorize sub-bullets, only the general names of the eight
buckets. When you get a new case, you will first select the three to
four buckets from your list of eight that are the most relevant. Then,
you will naturally think of the sub-bullets, depending on the
context of the case. This is where you have the opportunity to do
your own creative thinking. To develop these sub-bullets, you just
30

need to be very familiar and comfortable with what each of the
buckets mean.
1. Market attractiveness: Anything about the market goes into this
bucket. What is the market size? What is the market growth rate?
What are average profit margins in the market? What are the major
trends/changes going on in the market? Are there new technologies
in the market? Are there new regulations? Is the market developing
or mature? Is the market converging with another market?
2. Competitive landscape: Anything about competitors goes into
this bucket. Who are the competitors in the market? How much
market share does each player have? What products do competitors
sell? What capabilities do competitors have? What do some
competitors do to differentiate themselves from the other players in
the market? What are the barriers to entry?
3. Company attractiveness/company capabilities: Anything about
the company you are working with or the company that you are
looking to analyze or acquire goes into this bucket. What line of
products does the company offer? What ways do the products
differentiate themselves from other products? How much market
share does the company have? How profitable is the company?
What distribution channels does the company have? What
partnerships does the company have? How much buying power
does the company have? What is the go-to-market strategy of the
company? In what geographic regions is the company based in? Is
the company growing or declining?
4. Customer segmentation and needs: Anything about customers
in the target market goes into this bucket. What are the different
customer segments? What are the characteristics of each customer
segment? What are the needs/preferences of each customer
segment? How are customers changing in each customer segment?
How profitable is each customer segment?
5. Financial considerations: Anything regarding revenue, costs,
and profit goes into this bucket. Is the implication of this business
decision profitable? What are the different revenue elements? What
31

are the different cost elements? How can we increase revenues?
How can we decrease costs? What is the pricing strategy? How long
will it take to breakeven? What is the cost of acquisition? What is
the financial exit-strategy of this business decision?
6. Synergies: Anything about synergies between two companies, or
two products goes into this bucket. What are the possible revenue
synergies? What are the possible cost synergies? Are synergies
realizable? How long will realizing these synergies take?
7. Risks and mitigations: This is a versatile bucket that you can use
in frameworks where you need one more bucket but can’t think of
one. What are the risks of this business decision? What is the likely
impact of such risks? Can these risks be mitigated?
8. Create your own bucket: This eighth bucket gives you the
creativity and flexibility to create your own bucket. Sometimes
during a case, there will be a bucket that comes to mind that is
highly relevant to the case, but may not be explicitly captured by
the seven buckets above. Feel free to create your own bucket for
cases as long as the bucket follows the criteria of an exceptional
framework that was outlined earlier in this chapter.
Advantages of this framework strategy
What is the advantage of this framework strategy over all of the
other strategies out there?
First of all, with every case that you do, you are guaranteed to come
up with a custom and unique framework. You will not be using a
single generic framework that all of the other candidates have
memorized. It is a custom framework because you are choosing a
new combination of three to four buckets from the list of eight for
every case that you get. Granted, if you do two market entry cases,
your frameworks might be the same, but your framework for
market entry will be different from a merger and acquisition case, a
new product launch case, a pricing case, etc.
The framework you develop will also be unique in that no other
32

candidate out there will be using the same framework that you are.
Why? Because for each bucket you are creatively brainstorming two
to three sub-bullets that are specific to the case that you are solving
for. By leveraging this strategy, you instantly differentiate yourself
from the thousands of other candidates out there, the majority of
whom will be solving a case with a generic framework that they
memorized from another case interview book.
Secondly, this strategy is actually implementable. What do I mean
by this? Some other case interview books out there might tell you
what framework to memorize for every case scenario. If there are 15
different case scenarios, you’ll need to memorize 15 different
frameworks. Not only will your framework be generic and likely
not entirely relevant to the case objective, but very few people can
memorize 15 different frameworks. What if I told you that you only
had to memorize eight things? It is definitely more implementable
than memorizing 15 frameworks.
Thirdly, this strategy guarantees that you will not go blank during
the moment of silence when you brainstorm and structure your
framework. If you know your list of eight buckets by heart, you
have nothing to worry about when brainstorming your framework.
In the worst-case scenario, you can pick a few buckets that you
think are relevant to the case and go with those. You will never
have a blank sheet of paper to work with.
Examples of this strategy put to use
I have included some sample frameworks below that I developed
for common types of case interviews to give you some ideas for
how you can put this framework strategy to use. Again, you do not
need to memorize the frameworks below. You only need to
memorize the eight buckets described above and know how to use
this framework strategy.
Example 1: Market Entry Case – Should Company A enter Market
X?
Market attractiveness
33

What is the market size?
What is the market growth rate?
What are average profit margins in the market?
Company A capabilities
What capabilities can Company A leverage to enter
Market X?
Does Company A have any experience related to
Market X?
Is Company A able to handle the risks involved in
entering the new market?
Financial considerations
Will entering Market X be profitable?
How long will it take to break even?
Competitive landscape of Market X
Is the competitive landscape fragmented or
concentrated?
Do competitors in Market X have differentiated
capabilities or products?
What are the barriers to entry?
Example 2: Profitability Case – What is causing Company A to lose
profits? What can be done to address this issue?
Financial considerations
How have revenues changed for Company A?
Quantity
Price
How have costs changed for Company A?
Variable costs
Fixed costs
Competitive landscape
Have competitors done anything differently?
Have new competitors entered the market?
Have competitors also lost profits?

34

Customer segmentation and needs
Have customer needs or preferences changed?
Have customer purchasing behaviors changed?
Has the number of customers decreased?
Market trends
Are there any new technologies affecting the
market?
Are there any new regulations affecting the market?
What other major trends are occurring in the
market?
Example 3: Merger & Acquisition Case – Should Company A
acquire Company B?
Attractiveness of Company B
How profitable is Company B?
Does Company B have any differentiated
capabilities or products?
What is the brand name of Company B like?
Attractiveness of the market Company B is in
What is the market size?
What is the market growth rate?
What are the average profit margins in the market?
Synergies
What revenue synergies can be realized from the
acquisition?
What cost synergies can be realized from the
acquisition?
Are these synergies realizable?
Financial considerations
Is the acquisition of Company B at a fair price?
How long will it take to break even?
What are the possible exit strategies for acquiring
Company B?

35

What if I developed a framework different from the examples
above?
For a given case, there could be a chance that six or more of the
buckets are relevant to the case. How do you pick just three to four
buckets from these? The short answer is that you should pick the
three to four that are the most relevant to the case. In other words,
select the buckets that you think will give you the highest chance of
cracking the case.
Let’s say that for a given case, I select the following three buckets:
market attractiveness, company attractiveness, and financial
considerations. But you select market attractiveness, company
attractiveness, and competitive landscape. Which framework is
better? As long as the buckets are highly relevant to the case,
different frameworks can be used to solve the same case. That is the
beauty of this strategy. Each person using it will come up with a
unique framework.

36

V. Handling the Moment of Silence
Before you present your structured framework, there will be a few
minutes of silence when neither the interviewer nor you will be
talking. There are a few points here worth discussing.
The objectives of this part of the case are:
1. Do not take more than two to three minutes of complete
silence
2. Keep track of how much time has gone by
3. If you are approaching two to three minutes and need
more time, connect with the interviewer to let them know
you need another minute
There is nothing that the interviewer is explicitly evaluating you on
in this part of the case since there will be mainly silence. However,
the interviewer is still observing your demeanor and behavior. To
ensure that the interviewer does not form a negative impression of
you, make sure you are:
NOT spending more than two to three minutes in
complete silence
NOT visibly looking stressed or frantic
This is the only part of the case interview when it is okay for there
to be complete silence between you and the interviewer. For all
other parts of the case, the interview should be collaborative and
you and the interviewer should be talking back and forth in
discussion.
If you do not achieve the first objective, not taking more than two to
three minutes of silence, this can make the interviewer
uncomfortable. They could get worried that they will not be able to
get through the entire case with you. Interviewers will generally try
to get through the entire case with a candidate, even if the
37

candidate performs poorly. This makes the interview experience
better for both parties. I recommend that you practice developing
your framework for case interviews so that you can finish in under
two to three minutes comfortably.
For the second objective, how can you tell how much time has gone
by? The first method is practice. When you are doing mock case
interviews with your case partner, have them time how long it
takes you to develop your framework. From this feedback, you
should eventually be able to build in an “internal clock” so that you
know roughly how long one minute, two minutes, and three
minutes feel like. It is important to do this beforehand because in a
high-pressure situation like a case interview, time can pass slowly
or quickly, depending on how you are feeling.
An alternative method is to subtlety glance at your watch (if you
are wearing one). The only downside is that if the interviewer
catches you looking at your watch, it may make them feel like you
are in a rush to go somewhere. So, try not to make looking at your
watch too obvious.
For the third objective, if you feel that you are going over three
minutes and notice the interviewer getting restless and impatient,
you can do this one trick. Simply break the silence by saying
something like “I am just wrapping up now; I will need another 30
seconds” or “Thanks for your patience; I just need another minute
or so.” This may alleviate the awkwardness that comes with long
periods of silence. You can also make yourself sound confident as
you are saying these things since it shows you are proactively
monitoring your progress and the time.

38

VI. Presenting your Framework
Structuring your framework is the hard part; presenting it is the
easy part. For this part of the case interview, make sure that you:
1. Turn the paper around to face the interviewer so that they
can read your framework
2. Walk your interviewer through your framework at a
high-level
3. Check in with the interviewer so that they are aligned
with your framework
During this part, the interviewer is looking for:
A structured, relevant, and unique framework (see IV.
Developing a Structured Framework)
The ability to communicate in a clear, concise, and
confident way
For the first objective, I recommend that you physically turn your
paper around so that the interviewer is looking at your framework.
This will make it easier for your interviewer to understand how you
are thinking about the problem because they will be both reading it
and hearing it. However, this is not always possible, depending on
how the seating arrangement is set up.
For the second objective, walking your interviewer through your
framework, state how many areas you’d like to look into and then
list what the names of your buckets are. Then for each bucket,
spend 30 seconds discussing the most important sub-bullets of
each.
For the third objective, it is important to check in with the
interviewer to see if they are aligned with the framework and your
approach to the problem. Say something like “Does this sound
good?” or “Does that make sense?” As a reminder, you want to
39

touch base with the interviewer throughout the entire case
interview process so that you are on the right track.
Below is an example of how you should sound when you are
presenting your framework. For this example, let’s say that you are
given a case on whether or not a US strawberry jam producer
should enter the peanut butter market. You should present your
framework in the following way:
“To determine whether or not it is a good idea to enter the
peanut butter market, there are four areas I’d like to look into.
First, I’d like to look at the market attractiveness of the peanut
butter market. I’d like to look into what the market size is,
what the market growth rate is, and what the average margins
are in the peanut butter market. Essentially, I want to know: is
this market attractive enough for us to enter?
Second, I’d like to look at the competitive landscape. How
many competitors are in the market? How much share do they
have? I want to figure out if the market is concentrated or
fragmented, and what the barriers to entry are. By looking at
this category, we can better understand how difficult it would
be to enter.
Third, I’d like to look at our own company capabilities. Do we
have the ability to create a great peanut butter product? Do we
have any expertise in the area and know how to grow
peanuts? Do we know what the recipe for peanut butter
should be? Can we leverage our existing jam production
equipment? Or do we need to purchase new equipment
entirely? Can we leverage our existing customer and
distribution channels to sell peanut butter successfully?
For the fourth and final area, I’d like to look into the financial
considerations of entering the market. Will we be profitable by
selling peanut butter? How long will it take for us to break
even from the initial investment we put in? What is
management’s financial goals for entering the peanut butter
40

market, and can these goals be achieved? To do this, we can
project what revenues will be, and estimate what costs will be
to figure out what the profitability would look like.
Does this sound good?”
When you finish presenting your framework, the interviewer
should know exactly what the different buckets or areas that you
want to look into are. After this, you and the interviewer will begin
solving the case together.

41

VII. Starting the Case
Once you are finished presenting your framework, this is when
solving the case actually starts. All case interviews can be classified
into one of two types:
1. Cases that the interviewer leads
2. Cases that you lead
If the case is led by the interviewer, you will not be doing much
talking during this part of the case. If the case is led by you, then
there are a few things that the interviewer is looking for during this
part:
The ability to identify a high priority area to start the case
The ability to communicate in a clear, concise, and
confident way
I would estimate that most case interviews are led by the
interviewer, but there are some that you will lead. Some cases may
have a mix of the two, with you leading parts of the case, and the
interviewer leading other parts. It does not matter which type of
case interview you are given, the approach and methodology is
exactly the same.
Cases that the interviewer leads
For the first type of case, you will know if the case is led by the
interviewer because once you’ve presented your framework, the
interviewer effectively “takes over.” They will start you down a
path of analysis, or will ask you a question that you will both then
discuss. When you have completed that analysis or question, the
interviewer will guide or steer you towards the next analysis or
question. This will continue until the end of the case, when the
interviewer asks you for a recommendation that synthesizes
everything that you have learned so far.
42

After you present your framework, the interviewer might say
something like this: “That framework sounds great. Let’s start off
by estimating the market size. How would you approach
determining the size of the peanut butter market in the US?” This
type of dialogue is a clear indication of a case interview in which
the interviewer leads.
Cases that you lead
The second type of case interviews are the ones in which you are
expected to lead. These are a little bit more work. You may be
“leading” the case, but you still must get approval or confirmation
from the interviewer before actually doing any analysis or
discussion in one specific area. So in this sense, the interviewer is
still ultimately controlling which direction the case is going. The
interviewer is now just taking a slightly more passive role than in a
case interview that the interviewer leads.
Remember that you are collaborating with the interviewer. The case
interview should be a discussion with both parties talking, no
matter if the interviewer is leading the case or if you are leading the
case. The main difference with the latter is that once you’ve
presented your framework, your interviewer will ask where you
want to start.
When asked this, state in which area of your framework you’d like
to start and why. There is no wrong answer here as there is no way
for you to know which areas will have the key pieces of information
for solving the case. As long as you state where you’d like to start
and the reasoning behind it makes sense, you will be fine. If you
pick an area that the interviewer does not want to go down, they
will suggest an alternative area.
The most important part of solving a case that you are leading is to
check in frequently with the interviewer to make sure you are going
down the correct path.
Example: After you present your framework, the interviewer might
say something like this: “That framework sounds great. Where
43

should we start?”
You could say something like:
“I think we should start off by looking at the competitive
landscape. I want to figure out how concentrated or
fragmented the market is in order to determine how difficult it
would be to enter. We could also look into what the barriers to
entry are, and if they can be met. Does that sound good?”
If that is an area that the interviewer wants you to look into, the
interviewer would say something like “That sounds good. Let’s
look more into the competitive landscape.”
Conversely, if that is an area that the interviewer does not want you
to look into, the interviewer would say something like “While I
agree that looking at the competitive landscape makes sense, we
actually don’t have much information in that area. Why don’t we
start by sizing the peanut butter market instead?" The interviewer
could also ask you to propose another area to start solving and
answering the case.
Similarities between the two types of case interviews
For either type of case interview, if during any part of the case the
interviewer does not lead you where to go next, you should suggest
the next step or next area to move towards. Again, it does not
matter what area you suggest as long as it is a logical next step and
helps solve or answer the overall case objective. If it happens to be
an area that the interviewer wants you to drill down into, then the
interviewer will let you proceed with the suggested area. If it is not
what the interviewer had in mind, then the interviewer will step in
and guide you towards the area that they want you to go down.
In this sense, both of the two types of case interviews are exactly the
same. The interviewer is ultimately guiding you in both scenarios.
It is just a matter of whether or not the interviewer is blatantly
telling you which area to look into or you are deciding which area
to look into with approval and input from the interviewer. Just
44

make sure that you are prepared for both.

45

VIII. Solving Quantitative Problems
The majority of the quantitative work in a case interview will come
in either the form of market sizing or breakeven analysis. There
may be smaller quantitative questions asked, but if you can solve
market sizing and breakeven problems with ease, all quantitative
questions should be no problem for you.
This is what the interviewer is looking for:
General problem solving capabilities
Ability to provide structure to quantitative problems
Comfort in working with numbers; the ability to easily
execute basic mathematical computations (e.g. don’t
make a lot of math mistakes)
Ability to communicate in a clear, concise, and confident
way
For people that are earning or have earned a quantitative or
engineering degree, this part of the case will be the easiest for you.
For others, this part could be more challenging for you if you have
not done math in a while.
Whichever is the case, you only need to know how to do very basic
math. You need to know how to add, subtract, multiply, and
divide. You also need to know how to deal with percentages,
fractions, ratios and how to convert from one to another. Other than
these things, you really don’t need to know any more math beyond
that. You don’t need to know calculus, statistics, or more advanced
math.
Sounds easy right? Given the high pressure situation of a case
interview, even the most mathematically competent candidates get
nervous during these exercises and can easily make an arithmetic
mistake here and there. Therefore, it is important to consistently
46

check your work throughout long computations to ensure that you
have not made any mistakes.
Market sizing
The first type of quantitative problem solving is market sizing. In
simple terms, market sizing is an exercise in which you make
assumptions to calculate how large a market is.
Unless something else is specified, market size has the units of
dollars ($), or whatever other currency is being used, spent in one
year. Other versions of market sizing may ask you to estimate the
number of units sold, rather than estimate the monetary value of
the units.
Most of the time, market sizing is asked for just the US. However,
other times you might get asked for the global market size, so be
sure to specify which one you should be calculating with the
interviewer.
Examples of market sizing: (note that the units for these should be
in dollars spent in one year):
What is the size of the contact lens market?
How much money is spent on computers every year?
What is the market size of wine?
Some other examples: (note that these units are not dollars spent in
one year):
How many cars are sold in the US every year?
How many gallons of gas do Americans use every year?
How many minutes do Americans spend talking on their
phones every year?
These market sizing questions might seem tough to answer
47

immediately, but with enough practice, market sizing becomes
straight forward and repetitive.
At a high level, there are two different methods to tackle market
sizing. You can either take a top-down approach or a bottoms-up
approach. A top-down approach is when you start with a very large
number, and then refine/filter/drill-down until you get to the
answer. A bottoms-up approach is when you start with a small
number, and then build/multiply it up until you get to the answer.
Let’s say that we are asked to determine the market size of ice
cream in the US.
For a top-down approach, start with the number of people in the
US. Then, estimate what percentage of the US population eats ice
cream. Next, figure out how many pints of ice cream the average ice
cream consumer would eat in a week. From that, extrapolate how
many pints of ice cream are consumed in a year. Finally, estimate
the average price per pint of ice cream, and multiply everything
together to get the market size.
For a bottoms-up approach, start with a single ice cream store.
Then, estimate how many people visit the store a day and how
many pints of ice cream a person would purchase on average. Next,
calculate how much money the ice cream store makes in one day,
and extrapolate that to a year. Finally, estimate how many ice cream
stores are in a city or town and then figure out how many cities or
towns are in the US. Multiplying all of these things together gives
you the market size of ice cream.
I strongly recommend going with a top-down approach because it
is generally easier to work with. Why is it easier to work with?
Looking at the example above, it is not that difficult to make up
reasonable numbers for each assumption. You should know that
the US is roughly 300M people (320M is another common estimate).
You can estimate the percentage of people who eat ice cream by
thinking about your friends and family and how many of them
would eat ice cream. You can estimate how much a person eats by
thinking about how much you would reasonably eat in a week. You
48

can estimate the dollar ($) price per pint of ice cream from your
experiences in a supermarket or ice cream parlor. In other words,
all of these assumptions can be made up by you fairly easily
because you can relate to them.
Now let’s look at the bottoms-up approach. It is a little bit more
difficult to estimate how many people visit an ice cream store in
one day. You could estimate how long it takes you to walk into an
ice cream store, purchase ice cream, and then leave. You could then
divide the number of hours of operation the ice cream store is open
for to see how many customers the ice cream store can serve. But
then again, the ice cream store will not always be completely busy,
so you will have to scale down that number and assume that the ice
cream store is only busy 50% of the time. The extremely difficult
number to come up with is the number of cities/towns in the US.
Why? This is typically not a number that people have in the back of
their heads. Is it 1,000? Is it 10,000? Is it 100,000? Even deciding the
order of magnitude for this assumption is difficult. For this reason, I
recommend going with a top-down approach instead of a bottomsup approach. It is much easier to come up with numbers for the
assumptions that you will need to make.
Almost all market sizing questions I’ve received can be solved with
a top-down approach. However, if you feel that a bottoms-up
approach would be easier for a particular market sizing question,
then go with that method. It does not matter which method you
choose as long as the approach gets you to the answer in a simple,
easy way.
Now that we have the general approach out of the way, let’s
discuss the process of solving a market sizing question.
One mistake that interviewers commonly make is jumping right
into the math and calculations without taking much time to think
about their holistic approach. If you are an expert market sizer, this
is fine to do, but most of us need some time to process the question
and come up with a structure for what approach we want to use.
Therefore, the first step in solving a market sizing problem is to ask
49

the interviewer for some time to structure an approach. In almost
all case interviews, the interviewer will give you the time to
structure and frame your approach.
When developing your structure, avoid using numbers and avoid
doing any calculations at all. Remember, you are developing the
approach, or steps, that you are going to take to calculate the
market size. We are not making up any numbers or doing any math
calculations yet.
Let’s take the example of “What is the size of the contact lens
market in the US?” Using a top-down method, your approach
should be something like this written on your piece of paper:
The number of people in the US
Segmenting the number of people in the US by age
Estimating the percentage of each age group that has
vision problems
Estimating the percentage of people with vision problems
in each age group that wear contact lens (instead of
glasses or laser eye surgery)
Estimating the number of pairs of contact lenses one
person wears a year
Estimating the cost of a single pair of contact lenses
Multiplying across all of these will give you the market
size of contact lenses in the US
You would then share this approach with your interviewer and get
their approval or input before beginning to do any mathematical
calculations. You could say something like the following:
“In order to size the contact lens market in the US, I will first
start with the US population. I will then segment the US
population by different age groups because different age
50

groups have different percentages of people that have vision
problems.
Within each age group, I would estimate the percentage of
people that have vision problems. Next, I would estimate
what percentage of those folks wear contact lenses.
After that, I would estimate how many pairs of contact lenses
the average person wears in a year. Then, I will estimate the
price per pair of contact lens.
Finally, I can multiply all of these things together to get the
market size of contact lenses in the US.”
Again, notice that there are no numbers or math calculations done
when structuring the approach.
Once you have written this out on your piece of paper (you don’t
need to write out so many words as I did since you will be talking
over these points), communicate your approach with your
interviewer. In most cases, the interviewer will say that the
approach is fine, and you can start making assumptions and
calculations. In other cases, the interviewer might make some
comments to modify your approach so that it will be easier for you
to calculate the final answer.
Either way, once you’ve set up the approach to solve the market
sizing question, the rest is just doing simple arithmetic.
Let’s continue our example and assume that the interviewer
approves of our approach. In about half of all market sizing
problems, you will be expected to make up the numbers for all of
your assumptions. In the other half of market sizing problems, the
interviewer will have some numbers already made up for you to
use. To determine which scenario you fall under, you can simply
ask your interviewer whether they have any data that you can use,
or if you should make up numbers for your assumptions yourself.
Either way, when you are doing the math and performing the
51

calculations, there should not be silence between you and the
interviewer. You should be “doing math out loud” and walking the
interviewer through the calculations and assumptions. Also, you
should try to justify the numbers that you make up for your
assumptions. These numbers can be based on something that you
read, your experience in life, or any other methodology that you’ve
used to come up with the numbers.
Let’s continue our example of solving for the contact lens market
size in the US. You should say something like this as you are
calculating the market size:
“First, starting with the US population, let’s assume that there
are roughly 320M people in the US. To segment by age, I’m
going to assume four age groups of (0-20), (20-40), (40-60), and
(60-80). This means that there are 80M people in each of the
four different age groups.
I’ll assume that 20% of the people in the first age group have
vision problems. I chose only 20% because generally, I think
that your vision is good while you are young, but will get
worse with age. This means 16M (80M * 20%) people have
vision problems in this age group.
I’ll assume that 30% of people in the second age group have
vision problems. As people get older, there is a greater
likelihood that they will have vision problems due to aging.
Therefore, 24M (80M * 30%) people have vision problems in
this group.
I’ll assume that 50% of people in the third and fourth groups
have vision problems. Again, the rationale behind this is that
vision tends to get worse with age. Therefore, 80M (160M *
50%) people have vision problems across these two age
groups.
Adding up the four groups, we get a total of 120M people
with vision problems (16M + 24M + 80M). Based on thinking
about who among my friends and family wear contact lenses
52

instead of glasses, let’s assume roughly a third wear contact
lenses. That means 40M people wear contact lenses (120M *
1/3).
Next, let’s assume contact lenses are disposable, and 2 pairs
are needed each month. This is based on the disposable
contact lenses that I use. This means that one person would
need 24 pairs a year (2 pairs * 12 months).
Multiplying the 40M people who wear contact lenses with 24
pairs a year gives 960M pairs of contact lenses worn by people
in a year.
My contact lenses cost roughly $5 a pair. Therefore, the
market size of contact lenses is $4.8B (960M pairs * $5 per
pair). $4.8B is the market size for contact lenses in the US.”
Again, notice how I am walking the interviewer through every step
of the calculation. Even though it sounds painful, doing so will
greatly reduce the chance that you make a mathematical mistake
since you are doing the math out loud. It will also ensure that the
interviewer is following along.
Secondly, notice that I am providing some justifications for my
numbers. I am not making them up out of thin air, but trying to
explain where and how I got those numbers.
One common concern among candidates is that their answer will be
off by an order of magnitude or more. You should not worry about
this because the interviewer does not care about whether or not you
get the correct market size answer. If the correct answer is $4B,
someone who got an answer of $5B will not be perceived as a better
candidate than someone who got the answer of $10B. The
interviewer is evaluating you on: (1) the structured approach that
you developed in this market sizing exercise and (2) whether or not
you did the math easily without making any major mistakes.
A second concern among candidates is whether they should spend
time memorizing a bunch of different statistics that could help them
53

with market sizing problems. This could be helpful, but is not
worth investing too much of your energy or time on. There are only
two statistics that you have to memorize:
U.S. population is 300M or 320M (use whichever number
is easier to do math with)
World population is 7B
That is it. You can make up or estimate all of the other statistics or
numbers that you may need for market sizing.
With that said, here are three market sizing questions that you can
try on your own:
How many cars are sold in the US every year?
What is the market size of wine in the US?
How much money does a typical football game bring in?
Breakeven analysis
The second type of quantitative question that you might get asked
is a breakeven analysis. A breakeven analysis calculates what
would have to be true in order for you to achieve exactly zero
profits. This type of question is much easier than the market sizing
question because you simply follow a standard mathematical
equation that calculates the breakeven point.
Before we begin, let’s take a look at three simple equations that you
will need to know. For all of the equations below, I will bold the
ones that you must memorize and know by heart.
Profit = Revenue – Costs
Revenue = Quantity * Price
Costs = (Quantity * Variable Costs) + Fixed Costs
If we insert the last two equations into the first one, we get the
54

expanded formula for profit:
Profit = (Quantity * Price) – [(Quantity * Variable Costs) + Fixed
Costs]
A breakeven analysis looks at the scenario in which profit = 0.
Doing this with the profit equation above:
0 = (Quantity * Price) – [(Quantity * Variable Costs) + Fixed Costs]
Now, if we rearrange this equation, we can simplify it a bit to
derive the breakeven equation.
Quantity * (Price – Variable Costs) = Fixed Costs
You can use either the profit equation or the breakeven equation to
solve breakeven analysis problems. The first equation is the original
profit equation while the latter equation is the slightly simplified
version of the profit equation that already sets profit = 0. Notice
how both of the equations have four different variables (remember
profit = 0 in breakeven). In breakeven analysis, three of the
variables will be given, and you will solve for the fourth.
For example, let’s say that you are considering opening a pizza
store for a national pizza chain. You would sell pizzas at $10 each.
You estimate that the dough required to make a single pizza would
cost $0.50, the cheese would cost $0.75, the tomato sauce would cost
$0.75, and the toppings would cost $2.00 to make a single pizza. The
rent that you pay for the building would be $100K/year. You
would hire two employees at a salary of $75K/year per employee.
Finally, you would have to pay $50K a year royalty to the national
pizza chain that you are opening the store under for using their
brand and recipe. Assuming that there are no other costs, how
many pizzas would you need to sell in order to break even?
Price = $10/pizza
Variable Costs = $0.50 (dough) + $0.75 (cheese) + $0.75
(tomato sauce) + $2.00 (toppings)
55

Variable Costs = $4.00/pizza
Fixed Costs = $100K (rent) + [2 * $75K] (two employees) +
$50K (royalties)
Fixed Costs = $300K
Using the profit equation:
Profit = (Quantity * Price) – [(Quantity * Variable Costs) +
Fixed Costs]
0 = 10Q – (4Q + 300,000)
0 = 10Q – 4Q – 300,000
6Q = 300,000
Q = 50,000
You would need to sell 50,000 pizzas to break even.
Using the breakeven equation also yields the same answer,
but with one less step.
Quantity * (Price – Variable Costs) = Fixed Costs
Q * (10 – 4) = 300,000
6Q = 300,000
Q = 50,000
We get the same answer. You would need to sell 50,000 pizzas
to break even.
Now that you know how to solve market sizing and breakeven
analysis problems, you are ready to solve any quantitative problem
that gets thrown your way in a case interview.
Minimizing mistakes while doing math
56

It is very important to make no math mistakes during a case
interview. Remember, the interviewer is assessing your comfort in
working with numbers, and whether you have the ability to execute
basic mathematical computations with ease. You want to give off
the perception that math is easy and effortless for you. You may be
able to get away with a single miscalculation, but several math
mistakes reflect poor math capabilities.
The most common math mistake is missing a zero in a calculation
and being off by an order of magnitude. For example, if the correct
answer to the calculation is 10M, candidates may miss a zero and
arrive at 1M as the answer. The solution to this is to minimize the
number of zeros in your numbers by using “K”, “M”, and “B” to
represent one thousand, one million, and one billion respectively in
your calculations.
You should know that:
1,000 = 1K
1,000,000 = 1M = 1,000K
1,000,000,000 = 1B = 1,000M = 1,000,000K
Example: We have sold eleven million cars at a price of seventeen
thousand dollars. How much revenue is that?
$11M * $17K
($11 * $17) * (M * K)
($187) * (B)
$187B in revenue
Example: We have $143,000,000 in revenue and 13,000 customers.
What is the average spend per customer?
$143M / 13K
57

($143 / 13) * (M / K)
($11) * (K)
$11K spend per customer
Another strategy for minimizing math mistakes is to do your
calculation a second time quickly to see if you arrive at the same
number. While this strategy works, the downside is that if you do
this too many times or take too long to do your second calculation,
the interviewer may interpret that as a sign of weakness in your
math capabilities.
A third strategy is to do a quick sense check of your final answer
before communicating it to the interviewer. This is something you
should be doing every time you do a calculation and get an answer.
To do this, you can ask yourself the following questions:
Does this number make sense and seem reasonable?
Do I think this number is too low or too high?
Is there another number that I can benchmark or compare
this to?
You can differentiate yourself from other candidates by talking
through your sense check out loud. This shows the interviewer that
you are not just calculating numbers like a robot, but
conceptualizing the number to understand what it means and if it
makes sense.
Example: You perform a calculation and determine there are 3M
cars in the US.
“So I am getting that there are 3M cars in the US. Let me do a
quick sense check of this number. There are roughly 300M
people in the US, and if there are 3M cars, that means 1% of
the population has a car. This does not make sense, because
58

that figure is too low. Let me go back and see where I may
have missed a zero.”
Example: You perform a calculation and determine that a large
telecommunication company has annual revenues of $100B.
“The revenue I have calculated is $100B. Let me do a quick
sense check of this number. I interned at a large
telecommunication company last summer and know that they
have revenues of roughly $160B. The revenue I have just
calculated is also for a large telecommunication company, and
is roughly the same order of magnitude. Therefore, I think the
$100B revenue figure is reasonable.”

59

IX. Answering Qualitative Business Questions
Qualitative business questions test your logic, reasoning, and
general business intuition for basic business concepts.
This is what the interviewer is looking for:
Basic knowledge of business terms and principles
Astute, sharp business intuition
Structured responses to qualitative business questions
Ability to communicate in a clear, concise, and confident
way
In order to answer qualitative business questions, it is helpful to
have some basic business knowledge so that you are familiar with
basic terms and principles. This will help you develop an astute,
sharp business intuition for case interviews. Business/economics
majors and MBA candidates usually have acquired this knowledge
through the classes that they have taken. However, if you are not a
business/economics major or MBA candidate, don’t worry because
there is very little business knowledge that you actually need to
know. You will also quickly learn and develop an astute, sharp
business intuition from doing practice case interviews.
I have included a short business crash course reading below for the
basics of what you need to know. Even if you have a strong
business background, the following is worth a quick read or skim
as these business terms and principles show up frequently in case
interviews.
Fundamentals of business knowledge
Market Share: Market share is a way of measuring how much of a
presence a company has in a particular market. Mathematically, it is
calculated by taking the revenue a company has in a given market
and dividing it by the size of the market. Therefore, market share is
60

always between 0-100%.
Market Share = Revenue earned in a market ($) / Size of the market ($)
Say, for example, that a pet food manufacturer has revenues of
$10B. If the size of the pet food market is $50B, then that pet food
manufacturer has a 20% market share. ($10B/$50B)
A company with 80% market share has a significantly large
presence in the market. Conversely, a company with <1% market
share has a tiny presence in the market.
Profit margin: Profit margin measures how much a company
actually takes in from selling a product once costs have been
accounted for. It is calculated by taking the profit and dividing it by
the price of the product or revenue.
Profit Margin = Profit ($) / Revenue ($)
If I am selling pizzas for $10, but it costs me roughly $6 to make a
pizza, then my profit margin is 40% ($4 profit/$10 price).
Generally, companies want to invest more in higher margin
products because they make more money off of them. Lower
margin products are generally not as attractive because companies
keep a smaller percentage of what these products sell for, and they
are at risk of not being profitable if costs go up or if they have to
lower price to compete with other competitors.
Return on investment (ROI): ROI is a metric used to determine
how attractive a particular investment is. Mathematically, it is
calculated by taking the profit from the investment and dividing it
by the total investment cost for a given time period. There are 1year ROI calculations, 3-year ROI calculations, 10-year ROI
calculations, and so on. When calculating ROI make sure to clarify
what the time horizon is for the calculation.
ROI = Profit from Investment ($) / Investment Cost ($)
Let’s say, for example, that I can invest $50K in a friend’s pet shop
61

and expect a profit of $65K over the next two years. The alternative
option is to invest $12K in a coworker’s novel and earn $24K profit
in the next two years. In these two examples, we are interested in
the 2-year ROI.
The pet shop has an ROI of 1.3x ($65K/$50k) while the novel has an
ROI of 2x ($24K/$12K). So, the novel is a much more attractive
investment since I am getting higher returns for a given amount of
investment. However, note that in absolute dollars, the pet shop
would give you more money. The pet shop would net you $15K
($65K - $50K) while the novel would only net you $12K ($24K $12K). However, the novel has the higher ROI.
Barriers to entry: Barriers to entry are simply the obstacles that a
company would need to overcome to enter a new market. Examples
of barriers to entry are: capital, technical knowledge/expertise,
brand name, distribution channels, economies of scale, technology,
government regulation, and product differentiation.
Variable and fixed costs: Costs can be categorized into either
variable costs or fixed costs. The difference between the two is that
variable costs increase directly with the number or quantity of
product that is made while fixed costs do not. You can also think
about it this way: if you were to produce one more unit of product,
variable costs are the costs associated with producing that one extra
unit.
Let’s say that your business is selling pizza. The dough, the cheese,
the tomato sauce, and the toppings would all be variable costs. If
you were to produce one more pizza, you’d have to pay for more of
these ingredients.
Fixed costs on the other hand, do not change directly as the number
or quantity of product changes. In the pizza example, an example of
fixed costs would be rent that you pay for the building. If you were
to produce one extra pizza, you would still pay the same amount of
rent. Other examples of fixed costs are: utilities (electricity, gas,
etc.), salaries of workers (you would pay their salaries regardless of
how many pizzas are produced), and equipment/machines.
62

Fragmented vs. concentrated market: Fragmented and
concentrated are two different ways to describe the competitiveness
of a market. They are on opposite ends of the market
competitiveness spectrum.
A fragmented market is composed of many different companies,
with no company having a significantly large market share. For
example, a market with 100 different players each with 1% market
share would be a highly fragmented market.
A concentrated market is the opposite. Concentrated markets
usually have a few players that collectively have a large market
share. For example, a market where the top four players have 90%
of the market share would be a highly concentrated market.
The competitiveness of the market generally determines how high
the barriers to entry are. For a fragmented market, there are
generally low barriers to entry. The rationale behind this is that if
there were high barriers to entry, there would not be so many
players participating in the market. A concentrated market has high
barriers to entry. The rationale behind that is that there are only a
few large players in the market because they were the only ones
capable of overcoming the high barriers to entry.
Generally, it is easier to enter a fragmented market since the
barriers to entry are low. A concentrated market can only be
entered if the high barriers to entry are met, making it much more
difficult.
Supplier, manufacturer, distributor, and retailer: A supplier is
typically referred to as the company that sells raw materials to
another company, who then uses the raw materials to create a
product to sell in the market. The company that uses the raw
materials to create the final product is known as the manufacturer.
A distributor is typically a company that transports the final
product to places where the product can be sold. Retailers are
companies that sell the product.

63

Some companies do all four of these things: they gather their own
raw materials, manufacture their own product, distribute their
product to their stores, and sell their product through their own
stores. Other companies may only do one of these things.
For example, let’s say that your company makes frozen pizzas that
are sold in local grocery stores and large supermarkets. The
supplier would be the companies that you buy the dough, tomato
sauce, cheese, and toppings from. Your company then converts
these raw materials into the final product, a frozen pizza, making
your company the manufacturer. The distributor could be the
trucking company that takes the final product that is frozen pizza,
and delivers them to grocery stores and supermarkets, which are
the retailers.
Pricing strategy: There are many different ways to price a product
or an offering. Which method is best depends on the situation and
on what information is available. Each method has their own
advantages and disadvantages.
The first way to price a product is to determine how much a
customer is willing to pay for the product. This is usually done
through customer surveys and focus groups and is the most
straight forward approach. However, sometimes customers do not
know how much they’d pay for a hypothetical product, which is
one thing to consider when using this method.
A second way to price a product is to look at what price
competitors are selling their products for. You can then price your
product within the competitors’ range. The disadvantage of this
method is that it only works if competitors offer the same or similar
product to what you are trying to sell.
A third way to price a product is to look at how much it costs to
produce the product. You can then assign a profit margin to that
product and set the price accordingly. This method guarantees that
the product will have a certain profit margin when sold, but does
not consider the customer’s willingness to buy the product at that
given price point.
64

Buyer power (or purchasing power): Buyer power is a qualitative
measure of how much power a company has in setting the price of
raw materials or services that it purchases from a supplier.
For example, let’s say that there are two wooden furniture
manufacturers that each have 50% market share and purchase
wood, the raw material, from suppliers. Let’s say that there are
hundreds of different suppliers of wood. In this scenario, the
wooden furniture manufacturers have very strong or high buying
power. There are only two players that purchase wood, but
hundreds of different players that sell wood. Because of this
discrepancy, the wood sellers are more likely to sell wood at a
discounted price because there are only two players who they can
sell to, and they are competing with the other hundreds of sellers.
For the wooden furniture manufacturers, it is very likely that they
will be able to purchase wood at a preferred lower price point.
In the reverse scenario, let’s say that there are hundreds of cherry
pie producers that each have <1% market share. Let’s assume that
there are only two cherry suppliers in the market that sell raw
cherries. In this scenario, the cherry pie producers have very low
buying power. Since there are only two suppliers of cherries, but
hundreds of cherry pie producers that need to purchase these
cherries, suppliers do not need to offer discounts or reduced prices
in order to be able to sell their raw materials. It is unlikely that the
cherry pie producers will be able to purchase cherries at a price
point that they are happy with since they have low buying power.
In summary, buyer power is high or strong if buyers are more
concentrated than sellers. However, buyer power can also be strong
if there are many substitutes for the raw material that they are
buying, and if the costs of switching to a substitute raw material is
low.
For example, let’s say that a beef hot dog player purchases beef to
make hot dogs. If suddenly pork prices drop to a historic low, and
it is relatively easy for the hot dog player to switch to producing
pork hot dogs, then that player may have strong buyer power even
65

if the beef hot dog producer market is not heavily concentrated. The
beef hot dog player can ask for a lower price point from suppliers,
and threaten to switch to pork if prices are not met.
Reasons for making a merger/acquisition: There are many
different reasons why a company would want to buy or merge with
another company. The most common reason tends to be that a
company is lacking a particular product or offering in their
portfolio. Rather than invest the resources organically to develop
that product or offering, the company instead decides to acquire
another company that has that product or offering. This is done
because it might be easier and/or cheaper to acquire that missing
product into the portfolio rather than developing it themselves
from scratch.
A second common reason is for synergies. A synergy occurs when
the interaction of two parts (in this example, two companies)
produces a combined positive effect or outcome that is greater than
the sum of the two individual parts.
For example, if Company A, worth $7B, and Company B, worth
$3B, merge and have revenue synergies, then the combined value of
Company A and Company B could be $11B. This is $1B more than
the sum of the two parts had they been separate companies.
Synergies can be broken down into revenue synergies and cost
synergies. Examples of revenue synergies include: having access to
a new customer base or market, being able to cross-sell products to
existing customers, and sharing overlapping infrastructure or
distribution channels. Examples of cost synergies include:
headcount reduction from eliminating redundancies, reduced
overhead or fixed costs from consolidating functions (e.g. HR,
marketing), and increased buying power.
The third reason why a company would acquire another company
is because they see a smaller, high-growth competitor as a threat.
By acquiring the company, this eliminates such a threat. Doing
acquisitions is a way to grow the company and increase market
share without doing much work.
66

The fourth reason is that a company may purchase another
company just to diversify its portfolio.
For example, a beer company might purchase a soda company. Had
the beer company not purchased the soda company and a lot of
people stopped drinking beer, then the company would see a huge
drop in revenue. However, if the company had acquired a soda
company, the drop in revenue would not be as large because they
also sell soda, and soda sales may not have necessarily dropped if
beer consumption drops.
Private equity: The short, simplified definition of private equity is
that private equity is comprised of firms that generally have a lot of
money, that invest and/or purchase other companies for the sake of
getting a return on investment (ROI) in one way or another.
One way that they can get an ROI is by purchasing companies that
are not performing well that may or may not be profitable. They
then turn these companies around so that they are performing well
and profitable. Private equity firms would then sell off these
companies at a higher price than what these companies were
originally purchased for. You can think of this strategy as “flipping
companies”, much like a stock trader would flip stocks.
For mergers and acquisitions, companies that are not doing well
and are not profitable are generally not attractive targets to acquire.
However, for private equity firms, this is not the case because they
sometimes target these underperforming companies, turn them
around, and then sell for profit.
A second way that private equity firms can get an ROI is by
purchasing a company that would create synergies with the rest of
their portfolio. Remember, private equity firms can own many
different companies at the same time in their portfolio. The
synergies from an investment or purchase could enhance or
increase their overall portfolio ROI in the long-run.
If you get a case involving private equity, make sure to ask for what
67

strategy the private equity firm is looking to use to get an ROI. This
will dictate what qualities you need to look for in the companies
that may get bought out by the private equity firm.
Price sensitivity: Price sensitivity measures the change in quantity
of a product that a customer will purchase if the price changes. If a
customer is highly price sensitive, even a small increase in price
may cause them to stop buying the product altogether. If a
customer is not price sensitive at all, a small increase in price will
not cause them to purchase any less product.
For example, suppose you are price sensitive to clothes. If a
particular brand that you like has increased the prices of their
clothing, you are likely to purchase less from them. This is because
there are many other brands of clothing that you could purchase
from, and because you most likely don’t have an immediate need to
purchase new clothes.
In a different scenario, if you are diabetic, you are probably not
price sensitive to insulin shots. Why? First of all, there are no
substitutes for insulin shots because that is the only way for
diabetics to keep their blood sugar levels under control. Secondly,
diabetics must buy insulin shots because if they don’t, they could
die. Therefore, if the price of insulin shots increases, customers will
continue buying regardless.
In summary, just remember that increasing the price of a product
may not necessarily increase revenues due to price sensitivity. It is
important to figure out if the incremental revenue that you get from
increasing the price is greater than the loss of revenue from selling
less product. The same logic applies for when you are decreasing
the price of a product.
Ways to increase revenues: Revenue can be increased organically
and inorganically. Organic revenue growth is revenue growth that
a company achieves through its own efforts, internal to the
company. Inorganic growth is growth through a merger or
acquisition, done externally.

68

Let’s look into organic growth first. First, revenue can be increased
by increasing revenue from existing products. This can be done by
either increasing the quantity sold of the product or by changing
the price (remember which direction to change the price depends
on price sensitivity of the customers). Secondly, revenue can be
increased by selling entirely new products that you did not
previously offer.
For inorganic growth, merging or acquiring a company increases
revenue because you naturally will take in the revenue of the
acquired company.
Ways to decrease costs: We can think of reducing costs by either
reducing variable costs or reducing fixed costs.
Fixed costs are generally more difficult to reduce because fixed
costs are determined in the longer-run and have contracts or
“locked-in” costs that last for many years. For example, once
equipment purchases are made, they generally can’t have their
costs reduced since they are already purchased and are being used
for many years to come. However, fixed costs could be potentially
reduced if contracts are renegotiated, but the likelihood of this is
lower than the chance of reducing variable costs.
For example, the costs of rent for a warehouse (a fixed cost) could
be decreased if renegotiated with the landlord.
Variable costs tend to be easier to reduce. One way is that the
company can switch to a supplier that sells the same raw material
at a cheaper price. If the same raw material cannot be bought at a
cheaper price, the company can look for substitutes for that raw
material, but this is not always possible. Another way is that the
company can try to use less of each raw material in the production
process. However, note that any of these changes could affect the
quality of the product. As with fixed costs, another way to reduce
costs would be to renegotiate prices of raw materials with the
current supplier.
For example, a US toy manufacturer switches their plastic supplier
69

to a vendor in China in order to reduce the costs of plastic, a
variable cost.
Economies of scale: Economies of scale is the advantage that a
company gets in terms of buying power as it produces and sells
more and more product. As companies grow, they generally sell
more and more product such that they have more buying power
from suppliers. The increased buying power allows the company to
purchase raw materials and other variable costs at much lower
prices than competitors. This allows the company to price their
product at a lower price point. The lower price, in turn, allows them
to sell even more product, which results in even more increased
buying power. This cycle can repeat as the company continues to
grow.
The cycle described above is referred to as the process of a company
achieving economies of scale. The company’s costs get lower and
lower while they sell more and more product. This cycle eventually
does stop when suppliers are no longer able to reduce the costs of
raw materials that they can sell, because they too need to make a
profit off of the sale of raw materials. At this point, the company
has achieved the maximum benefit of economies of scale.
Companies that have achieved economies of scale are buying raw
materials at the lowest price point possible, allowing them to sell a
large quantity of product and achieve high market share.
How to answer qualitative business questions
The following are some examples of qualitative business questions
that you may get asked. Unfortunately, it is not possible for me to
list every possible qualitative question that you will get. There are
way too many possible questions. I just want to give you a sense of
the type of questions that you may be asked and the level of detail
you are expected to answer them at. Note that none of these
questions require very specific business jargon or technical
knowledge.
What are some barriers to entry in the cable TV market?
70

What are some variable and fixed costs that you can think
of for starting a food truck?
What are some reasons for why a pharmaceutical
company would buy another pharmaceutical company?
What are some ways to increase video game revenue?
How can we decrease manufacturing costs of wooden
furniture?
How much market share do you think we can capture in
this new market?
Looking at our portfolio of four products. Which ones
should we invest heavily in? Which ones should we
divest?
What are some ways we can price this new product?
Do you think this is a competitive market?
So how do you differentiate yourself from the thousands of other
candidates out there? There are several ways that you can do this.
First of all, structure. I would say that when asked a qualitative
business question, most candidates will immediately start talking
off the top of their heads about any ideas or thoughts that they
have. To differentiate yourself, I recommend that you take an extra
five to ten seconds to structure your answer. What do I mean by
this?
For example, let’s take a look at two different responses to a
qualitative question such as: “What are some benefits to hosting the
Super Bowl?”
An ordinary candidate might say something like this:
“There are many benefits to hosting the Super Bowl. First of
71

all, you can bring money into the city from selling tickets to
the event. Secondly, you can bring national attention and
recognition to the city, since the entire US will likely be
watching it on television or keeping up with it. Third, an
increase in guests will probably lead to increased spending in
the city economy overall.”
While this answer definitely works and makes sense, one critique is
that the candidate simply listed the top three random ideas that
came to their head. For this reason, the response may appear to
ramble on or repeat a few points.
Compare this answer to the following one from a candidate who
spent an extra five to ten seconds structuring their response:
“There are both short-term and long-term benefits that can be
realized from hosting the Super Bowl. Starting with the shortterm benefits, the big thing that comes to mind is revenue.
Hosting the Super Bowl can bring revenue into the city, from
ticket sales to hotel and housing spend, food and drink
consumption, and general tourist purchases. For the long-term
benefits, one such benefit would be city branding/reputation.
With the entire US keeping up with the Super Bowl, this is a
long-term opportunity for the city to create a positive image of
itself to encourage future tourism.”
Notice how much more organized and easy to follow this second
answer is from the first? Having a simple structure to your
qualitative answers makes a big difference in differentiating
yourself from the other candidates.
Here is a list of quick mini-frameworks that you can leverage to
structure your answer:
Internal/external
Short-term/long-term
Economic/non-economic
72

Quantitative/qualitative
By using these pairings of words, your answers will be much more
organized than the majority of the rest of the candidates.
The second way to differentiate yourself is from creative
brainstorming. You can show creativity in two different ways.
The first way is to simply list a large quantity of ideas. For example,
if a candidate is asked for barriers to entry in a particular market
and is only able to come up with two ideas, that candidate has
probably given an answer that is very average among candidates.
However, if one candidate comes in and is able to list seven or eight
ideas (this is actually quite a lot; I am exaggerating the number to
illustrate this example), then that candidate has differentiated
themself from the pack.
The second way to demonstrate creativity is to come up with an
idea that none of the other candidates had thought of. Some people
can naturally come up with more creative and unique ideas than
others. However, it is very difficult to improve on this skill in a
short period of time.
With that said, I recommend that you invest the majority of your
time on structuring your responses and being able to come up with
many ideas for each qualitative question. This will differentiate
yourself from the rest of the candidates.

73

X. Delivering a Conclusion
Delivering the conclusion is the last impression that you will leave
with the interviewer. Therefore, it is important that you deliver a
solid conclusion and recommendation.
A good conclusion and recommendation satisfies the following
criteria:
1. Starts with a confident, assertive recommendation
2. Is structured
3. Includes next steps
During this part of the case, the interviewer is looking for your:
Ability to synthesize all of the information discussed
during the case and pull out the key takeaways
Ability to deliver a firm recommendation backed by facts,
business acumen, and judgement
Ability to communicate in a clear, concise, and confident
way
For the first criteria, make sure that your conclusion starts with
your recommendation. The very first sentence of your conclusion
should state an assertive recommendation.
One common mistake many candidates make is that they begin
their conclusion by summarizing the problem, and then describing
the process and the steps that they have gone through before
arriving at the recommendation. For case interviews, you want to
start with the recommendation first. The answer should come first,
not last.
The second common mistake is that when prompted for a
recommendation, candidates will often heavily hedge their
74

recommendation. However, interviewers might interpret this as
you being unconfident and unassertive. Even if you feel that your
recommendation might not be the correct one, I recommend that
you pick a side and present your recommendation in a firm and
assertive manner. If you feel strongly that your recommendation
may not be correct, you can hedge your recommendation in the
“next steps” portion of the conclusion.
For the second criteria, structure is highly important for the
conclusion. I would recommend that you use a structure similar to
the one below. It is simple, clean, and effective.
A structured conclusion should look something like this:
I recommend that we (insert recommendation) for the
following three reasons:
1) …
2) …
3) …
For these reasons, I recommend that we (insert
recommendation)
For next steps, I would like to look into the following two
things:
1) …
2) …
For the third criteria, including “next steps” in your conclusion is
important because it shows that you are thinking ahead of areas
that you would like to further look into if you had more time. Most
candidates do not discuss next steps, so including this part can help
you differentiate yourself from the other candidates.
You shouldn’t necessarily be doing any novel thinking to come up
with next steps. During the case interview, there should have
naturally been a couple of points where you wished you had more
information or where you wanted to do another piece of analysis.
You can use these points as your next steps. Therefore, next steps
75

should not always be new ideas that the interviewer is hearing for
the first time.
For example, leveraging the structure above, a strong
recommendation and conclusion would sound something like this:
“I recommend that we do not enter the peanut butter market
for the following three reasons.
One, we looked at the competitive landscape and learned that
the top four players have 90% of the market share. This
suggests that the market is highly concentrated with high
barriers to entry.
Two, we looked into possible synergies with our existing
strawberry jam product. Peanut butter and strawberry jam
have little to no synergies. We would have to buy new
equipment and develop a proprietary peanut butter recipe to
enter the peanut butter market.
Three, we looked at the financial considerations and
determined it would take ten years for us to break even in this
market. Since management is looking for additional profit in
the next two to three years, entering the market does not make
sense financially.
For these reasons, I recommend that we do not enter the
peanut butter market.
For next steps, I would like to look into the following two
things to further confirm my recommendation. One, I’d like to
look into the overlap between strawberry jam customers and
peanut butter customers. If there is no overlap, we probably
can’t cross-sell strawberry jam with peanut butter and
leverage our existing customer relationships. Two, since it
doesn’t seem like we want to enter the market organically, it
may be worth looking into partnerships or strategic alliances
to see if these are attractive enough for us to consider entering
the market inorganically.”
76

Transitioning from solving the case to presenting a
recommendation and conclusion can be fairly challenging. During
the case, you most likely will have covered quite a bit of ground on
a variety of topics. The challenging part of the conclusion is pulling
together all of the key findings that you have discovered and
determining what these key findings mean for the answer.
You should have been taking brief notes on key takeaways
throughout the case on your note sheet. Having done this, you
simply need to quickly scan through your notes to review what the
key takeaways are, and think about what that means for the
answer.
It is acceptable for candidates to ask their interviewer for 30 seconds
to read through their notes and organize their thoughts before
delivering a structured conclusion. However, if your interviewer
gives you time to think through the conclusion, they will expect
more structure from you than if you immediately started delivering
your recommendation and conclusion when prompted for a
summary. Make sure your conclusion is structured if you are going
to be asking for time to gather your thoughts.

77

XI. Everything You Need to Memorize
There are actually not that many things you need to memorize for
case interviews. More of it comes down to understanding and
mastering concepts. This comes with practice. Below are all of the
things that we’ve covered that should be memorized.

Introduction to Doing Practice Cases
Where to find practice cases
There are five practice cases in this book. Once you finish these,
there are hundreds, if not thousands, of cases out there on the
internet, most available for free. You can do a quick internet search
for “consulting business school casebooks.” If your school has a
consulting club, they will likely have an archive of casebooks as
well.
How to do practice cases effectively
The best way to do practice cases is to simulate a real case interview
as closely as you can. That means putting away all books and notes,
not using a calculator, and not taking any breaks during a practice
case.
I strongly recommend that you do all practice cases with a case
interview partner, who will deliver the case to you and give you
feedback. You can find case interview partners at your school, as
other people are likely also preparing for consulting case
interviews. There are also resources online where you can find and
connect with others around the world to practice cases through
video or phone call.
Choose your case interview partner carefully, as they will make all
the difference on how quickly you will get better. Ideally, you want
to pick someone who is:
Experienced with case interviews
Capable of delivering detailed, tactical, and actionable
feedback
Determined and motivated to practice as many cases as
you are
Available to practice cases when you have the time
80

If your case interview partner doesn’t deliver cases the right way or
provides mediocre feedback, they will not be helpful to you.
How it typically works with a case interview partner is that one of
you will be the interviewer and the other the candidate. The
interviewer will read the entire practice case interview beforehand
to know exactly how the case will proceed and what information is
available to give the candidate. The interviewer will then deliver
the case to the candidate. A practice case should take 45 minutes to
an hour to complete. At the end of the case, the interviewer will
give feedback to the candidate. The feedback session should take
about 15 minutes, possibly even 30 minutes if you are new to doing
cases.
For the next case, roles will be switched. The interviewer will be the
candidate, and the candidate will be the interviewer.
By the time you complete ten practice cases, you will also have
given ten practice cases. You may feel that you are wasting your
time giving someone else a practice case, but you can learn quite a
bit by giving practice cases. You can understand how someone else
approaches solving a case and can leverage that in the future. You
also put yourself in the shoes of an interviewer and attain a better
understanding of what interviewers are looking for.
It may be helpful to video record yourself during practice case
interviews. This way you can analyze your body gestures and
speaking patterns. Oftentimes, you’ll be surprised with your body
language or what you actually say during a practice case. I
wouldn’t do this with every practice case, but I’d try to do this
every time you feel that you have taken a significant step forward.
Practice cases in this book
Although I strongly encourage you to practice case interviews with
a partner, the practice cases in this book are written so that you can
do them alone or with a partner. However, after these first few
cases, you should definitely be doing case interviews live with a
81

case interview partner.

82

Practice Case #1 – It’s Wine O’Clock Somewhere
Difficulty: Beginner
The company you are working with is called Beer Co. They
manufacture, distribute, and sell over a hundred different varieties
of beer, including lagers, pilsners, ales, and stouts in the US. They
sell to restaurants, bars, wholesale retailers, and directly to
consumers. Recently, however, they have been experiencing a
decline in revenue across the majority of their beer products.
Because of this, the VP of Business Strategy has considered entering
the wine market in hopes of increasing revenue and profit.
Should Beer Co. enter the wine market?
(Sample framework is on the following page)

83

Sample Framework: One possible framework could look something
like the following. The candidate does not need to have this exact
framework, but should capture most of these points.
Attractiveness of the wine market
What is the size of the wine market?
What is the growth rate of the wine market?
What are the average profit margins for a wine
producer in this market?
How do these compare to the beer market?
Competitive landscape of the wine market
How many competitors are in the market?
How much share does each player have?
What are the barriers to entry for this market?
Beer Co.’s capabilities to enter the wine market
What existing capabilities can Beer Co. leverage to
enter the wine market?
Does Beer Co. have sufficient capital to enter the
market?
Financial considerations
Will it be profitable to manufacture and sell wine?
How long will it take to break even if Beer Co.
enters the wine market?

84

Question 1: Let’s begin by determining the market size of wine in
the US. Is the wine market a large market?
(Sample answer is on the following page)

85

Answer to Question 1: Remember, the final answer that the
candidate comes up with does not matter. What matters is the
approach that the candidate takes and the proficiency at which they
do math.
Structure for determining the market size for wine in the US:
Start with the US population
Segment the US population by age
Estimate what percentage of each age group consumes
wine
Estimate how many bottles of wine a wine drinker
consumes in a year
Estimate the average price of a bottle of wine
Multiply across these numbers to determine the market
size of wine
Let’s assume that the US population is 320M people. Let’s divide
the US population into four different segments: (0-20), (20-40), (4060), and (60-80). Each segment has 80M people.
For (0-20), let’s assume 0% of people drink wine because consuming
alcohol under the age of 21 is illegal in the US. Therefore, 0M wine
drinkers in this segment. (0% * 80M)
For (20-40), let’s assume 30% of people drink wine based on our
personal experiences with friends and family members’ drinking
preferences. Therefore, there are 24M wine drinkers in this
segment. (30% * 80M)
For (40-60), let’s assume 30% of people drink wine as well based on
personal experiences. Therefore, there are 24M wine drinkers in this
segment. (30% * 80M)
For (60-80), let’s assume that 15% of people drink wine. The
86

rationale behind this is that as people reach this older age segment,
they must be more careful of what they eat and drink due to health
concerns. Therefore, there are 12M wine drinkers in this segment.
(15% * 80M)
Adding up the wine drinkers across these four age segments, we
get 60M wine drinkers. (24M + 24M + 12M)
Next, let’s assume that wine drinkers consume one bottle every
week. There are 52 weeks a year, but let’s assume 50 weeks to make
the calculations simpler. Therefore, each wine drinker consumes 50
bottles of wine in a year.
From this, we calculate that there are 3B bottles of wine consumed a
year in the US (60M * 50)
Based on personal experiences, let’s say that the average bottle of
wine is $20. Therefore, the market size of wine in the US is $60B.
(3B * $20)
To determine if we consider the wine market to be large, we need to
compare the market size to something else. In this case interview, it
makes sense to compare it to the size of the beer market.
If the candidate asks, the size of the beer market is $40B. Therefore,
the candidate should use this benchmark to compare with the size
of the wine market in order to rationalize whether or not the wine
market is a large market.

87

Question 2: Let’s say that the top three players in the wine market
have 80% of the market share. What does this tell you about the
barriers to entry? What are some examples of barriers to entry in
this market?
(Sample answer is on the following page)

88

Answer to Question 2: The fact that the top three players have 80%
of the market share means that the market is very concentrated.
Since there are only a few major players in the market, barriers to
entry into the wine market are likely high.
Barriers to entry can be segmented into two buckets: economic
barriers to entry and non-economic barriers to entry.
Economic barriers to entry
Capital required to purchase the equipment for
wine production
Fertile, suitable land to grow grapes
Distribution channels and infrastructure to reach
and deliver to customers
Economies of scale to have cost advantages
Non-economic barriers to entry
Brand name in the wine market
Knowledge/expertise to produce superior wine
Product differentiation for the wine being produced
Time required for wine to age

89

Question 3: Next, let’s take a look at Beer Co.’s current capabilities.
Do you think there are any synergies that can be realized between
producing beer and producing wine?
(Sample answer is on the following page)

90

Answer to Question 3: It does not matter whether the candidate
says that there are few synergies or many synergies. The important
thing to look for is whether the answer is structured and logical. A
sample answer is shown below.
There does not appear to be many synergies between beer and
wine. Let’s think about three different types of synergies: synergies
arising from manufacturing of product, synergies arising from
shared customers, and synergies arising from the workforce.
Synergies arising from manufacturing of product: There are not
many synergies arising from the production of both wine and beer.
Wine comes from grapes, while beer comes from barley, corn, or
rice. Therefore, they do not share much raw materials. On top of
that, the process in which wine and beer ferments is likely different,
so the same machines and storage probably can’t be used.
Synergies arising from shared customers: There could be some
customer sharing between wine drinkers and beer drinkers.
However, I’d imagine that the overlap is not that large. People who
like beer will buy predominantly beer, while people that like wine
will predominantly buy wine.
Synergies arising from the workforce: There are not a whole lot of
synergies here because the skills needed to produce beer and wine
are different. Beer and wine come from different raw materials, and
the process to produce the two products are very different.
Therefore, employees who produce beer may not be able to help
with producing wine without substantial training. The same could
be said about employees who produce wine.

91

Conclusion: Let’s say that the VP of Business Strategy has just
walked in and wants a preliminary summary and recommendation
of what you have learned so far. What do you say?
(Sample conclusion is on the following page)

92

Sample Conclusion: It does not matter whether the
recommendation is to enter the market or not to enter the market.
As long as the conclusion is structured and is backed up by the
points previously discussed, the conclusion will work.
I recommend that we do not enter the wine market for the
following three reasons:
One, the wine market has high barriers to entry. The market is
concentrated with the top three players having 80% of the market
share. It will be difficult to enter this market because of a variety of
barriers, such as capital, the knowledge/expertise to produce
superior wine, and brand name.
Two, although the market size is relatively large at $60M, compared
to $40M that is the beer market, we will not be likely to capture
much market share because of the high barriers to entry.
Three, there are very little synergies between producing beer and
wine. The two products have different raw ingredients, and the
production process is quite different.
Therefore, I recommend that we do not enter the wine market.
However, given more time, there are two things that I’d like to look
into to further validate my recommendation. One, I’d like to look
into existing capabilities that Beer Co. can leverage to enter the
market. Two, I’d like to do a breakeven analysis to determine if
entering the wine market will even be profitable.

93

Author Commentary: Market entry and profitability cases are the
two most common cases for first-round interviews. This case is a
very standard market entry case. Expect to be given a market sizing
problem or profit/breakeven calculation, followed by a few
qualitative questions in a first-round interview.
You should practice to be able to develop a framework for any
market entry case quickly and easily. Because it is so common, this
is an essential framework to have in your back pocket.

94

Practice Case #2 – Clothes Woes
Difficulty: Beginner
The client who has hired you is a clothing manufacturer. They
make daily-wear clothing for both men and women. They sell their
clothing at their own physical stores in malls around the world. The
clothing company was doing quite well and were very profitable a
few years ago. However, profits have gone down significantly since
then.
What is causing the decline in profits? What can be done to address
and fix this problem?
(Sample framework is on the following page)

95

Sample Framework: One possible framework could look something
like the following. The candidate does not need to have this exact
framework, but should capture most of these points.
Financial situation
How has revenue changed during this time period?
Quantity
Price
How have costs changed during this time period?
Fixed Costs
Variable Costs
Customer segments
Have customer preferences changed during this
time period?
Do customers perceive or view our company
differently than before?
Competitive landscape of the clothing market
Have new competitors entered the market?
Are competitors doing something different than
what they were doing previously?
Clothing market
Has profitability declined for the clothing market
overall?
Are there new government regulations affecting
clothing manufacturing?
Are there new technologies disrupting the clothing
market?

96

Question 1: Let’s begin by looking at revenues and profit margins
of the different clothing product lines that we sell. How much have
absolute profits decreased overall? Which product lines are seeing a
decline in absolute profits?

Answer to Question 1: To determine which product lines are seeing
a decline in profits, we need to calculate profits for each product
line for both before and now. From this we can see what product
lines have a decline in profits.
Profits can be calculated by multiplying revenue by the profit
margin. Revenue is calculated by multiplying the quantity sold and
the price sold at. It is useful to create a summary table like the one
below.
Profit Before

Profit Now

Jackets

$5M

$5M

Shirts

$25M

$16M

Pants

$27M

$30M

Shoes

$10M

$4M

Total

$67M

$55M

Profits have decreased by $12M from $67M to $55M. The two
product lines that are seeing a decline in absolute profits are shirts
(declined by $9M) and shoes (declined by $6M). The profits
coming from jackets have not changed. The profits coming from
pants have actually increased from $27M to $30M.

98

Question 2: Looking at the information that you have for quantity
sold, price sold at, and profit margin for each of the product lines,
what is causing each product’s profits to change the way that it
does? In other words, what explanation can you give for why each
product’s profits are changing?
(Sample answer is on the following page)

99

Answer to Question 2: Let’s go through the different product lines
one at a time.
Looking at jackets, the price has not changed between before and
now. The reason why jackets have the same profits is because the
quantity sold has doubled while the profit margin has halved.
Therefore, profits have not changed.
Looking at shirts, the price has also not changed. The reason why
shirts have decreased in revenue is because the quantity sold has
decreased and the profit margin has decreased. Since price has not
changed and margins have decreased, this implies that costs have
increased. So, a decrease in quantity sold and an increase in costs is
what is causing the decline in profits.
Looking at pants, the price has also not changed. Although the
quantity sold has decreased, the profit margin for pants has
increased enough such that profits overall for pants have increased.
Finally, looking at shoes, the profit margin has remained the same,
but the price has increased significantly. It is possible that the
increase in price has caused a drastic decrease in quantity sold due
to customer price sensitivity. This is what has caused the decline in
profits.

100

Question 3: Let’s focus on shirts right now. Can you brainstorm
different ways that we can increase profits for shirts?
(Sample answer is on the following page)

101

Answer to Question 3: Looking at shirts, we determined that the
decrease in profits was due to both a decline in quantity sold and a
decline in profit margin (meaning an increase in costs since price
has stayed the same). Therefore, we can brainstorm different ways
to increase profits both on the revenue side and cost side.
Increase Revenue
Increase quantity sold
Marketing campaign to increase sales (TV ads,
newspaper ads, radio broadcasting, flyers,
celebrity endorsements, etc.)
Sell the shirt in more retail stores in different
geographic regions
Sell shirts in bundles to encourage purchases
of higher quantities
Change price
Increase price to increase revenue IF the
quantity of shirts sold will not decrease
significantly due to the increase in price
Decrease price to increase revenue IF the
quantity of shirts sold will increase
significantly due to the decrease in price
Decrease Costs
Decrease variable costs
Renegotiate purchasing price for raw materials
used to make the shirt
Use cheaper substitutes for raw materials used
to make the shirt
Use less fabric to make each shirt (making the
shirt thinner)
Decrease fixed costs
Invest in new equipment or technology that is
more cost efficient to produce shirts

102

Renegotiate distributor or retailer contracts
Renegotiate salaries

103

Question 4: Now let’s look at shoes. A popular, high-end
department store has approached you to enter into a strategic
partnership. Under the terms of the contract, you will not be able to
sell shoes anymore. However, the department store will sell your
shoes for you under their famous brand name. They will sell the
shoe at $100 and promise that at least 1.2M shoes will be sold. The
profit margins will still be 20%, but they will take 65% of the profits.
You keep the rest of the profits.
Based purely on the economics of this deal, should you do this
strategic partnership? Assume that without the partnership, shoe
profits will be $4M, as they are now.
(Sample answer is on the following page)

104

Answer to Question 4: To determine whether to do this strategic
partnership, we will compare profits that we would get from selling
shoes ourselves with the expected profits we would get if we
entered into this partnership.
If we do not enter the partnership, we will have shoe profits of $4M.
With the partnership, we will sell at least 1.2M shoes at $100. This
means revenues will be at least $120M. Since profit margins are
20%, profits will be at least $24M. However, the high-end
department store will take 65% of the profits. This means that we
will collect 35% of the profits.
Therefore, your shoe profits will be at least $8.4M.
Based purely on economics, we should do this strategic
partnership. We will increase shoe profits from $4M to at least
$8.4M, more than doubling shoe profits.

105

Conclusion: Let’s say that the CEO has just walked in and wants to
know what is causing the decline in profits and what can be done to
resolve these issues and increase profits? What do you say?
(Sample conclusion is on the following page)

106

Sample Conclusion: To increase profits, I recommend that we
increase profits for the following two product lines: shirts and
shoes. These are the two product lines that are causing the decline
in profits for the company overall.
First, looking at shirts, profits have gone down because quantity
sold has decreased and costs have increased, which drives a lower
profit margin. To address this, we can look at both the revenue side
and cost side.
On the revenue side, we can increase quantity sold by launching a
marketing campaign, selling the shirt in more geographic regions,
or bundling shirts together. We can also increase revenue by
adjusting the price of the shirt.
On the cost side, we can try to reduce variable costs by
renegotiating prices for raw materials or using cheaper substitutes
for our raw materials. We can also try to reduce fixed costs by
investing in more efficient equipment or renegotiating salary or
retailer contracts.
Second, looking at shoes, we can increase profits by entering into a
strategic partnership with a high-end department store. Although
the department store will take 65% of profits, we will still expect
profits to increase from $4M to at least $8.4M, more than doubling.
By addressing the decline in profits from shirts and shoes, we can
increase profits for the company overall.
For next steps, I’d like to look into two things. One, I’d like to look
into jackets to see if we can increase profits since profits for jackets
have remained flat. Second, I’d like to look into pants and see if we
can further increase profits because pants are the only product line
that has actually increased in profits.

107

Author Commentary: Profitability and market sizing cases are the
two most common cases for first-round interviews. This is a typical
profitability case in which you dive into various revenue segments
and determine what is at the root-cause of the profitability problem.
You should be able to work with numbers and calculations
involving: quantity, price, revenue, costs, profit, and profit margin
comfortably, without making any mathematical mistakes. This is
another essential skill to have, especially for first-round interviews.

108

Practice Case #3 – Let’s Bank on it
Difficulty: Moderate
Bank Co. is a large Nigerian bank that offers checking accounts and
savings accounts to customers. They are the fourth largest bank in
Nigeria and have over $10B in total deposits. Currently, Bank Co.
does not offer credit cards to their customers while the top three
banks do.
Bank Co. has done some diligences and has identified a possible
credit card company acquisition target named Nigeria Card. Should
Bank Co. acquire Nigeria Card so that they can offer credit cards to
customers?
(Sample framework is on the following page)

109

Sample Framework: One possible framework could look something
like the following. The candidate does not need to have this exact
framework, but should capture most of these points.
Financial considerations
Is Nigeria Card being acquired at a fair price?
How long will it take to break even from the
acquisition costs?
Nigeria Card company attractiveness
Is Nigeria Card profitable?
How much market share does Nigeria Card have?
How is the brand name of Nigeria Card perceived
by customers?
Does Nigeria Card have any capabilities or offerings
that differentiates itself from competitors?
Credit Card market attractiveness
What is the size of the credit card market?
What is the growth rate of the credit card market?
What are the profit margins like in the credit card
market?
Synergies
Are there any revenue synergies between banking
accounts and credit cards?
Are there any cost synergies?

110

Question 1: Before we look into the financial considerations, let’s
think about synergies between a banking company and a credit
card company. Are there any synergies that can be realized from
this acquisition?
(Sample answer is on the following page)

111

Answer to Question 1: It does not matter whether the candidate
says that there are few synergies or many synergies. The important
thing to look for is whether the answer is structured and logical. A
sample answer is shown below.
There are several synergies that can be realized from this
acquisition. Synergies can be segmented into revenue synergies and
cost synergies.
Let’s start with revenue synergies first. One, it may be possible to
cross-sell credit cards when selling banking services, or vice-versa.
The reason for this is that a customer that is looking for banking
services, is also probably looking for a credit card, since they are
both related to personal finance. Two, acquiring a credit card
company would give Bank Co. access to Nigeria Card’s customer
distribution channels. This would give Bank Co. access to new
customer bases that they can sell to.
Next, let’s move onto cost synergies. One, there could be a
headcount reduction for redundant functions. For example,
salesforce for the two companies could be reduced by training sales
people how to sell both banking accounts and credit cards. Two,
there could be a reduction of overhead, such as physical facilities
and IT infrastructure.

112

Question 2: Bank Co. is hoping to break even from the acquisition
costs within three years. Is this goal achievable? Here is some
information:
The target price for the acquisition target is $14B.
Nigeria Card currently has 20M customers.
There are three different sources of revenue for credit cards.
Annual fee: The annual fee for a credit card is $50 a year
Credit card transaction revenue: When a consumer uses a
credit card, Nigeria Card gets 3% of the total amount
spent on the card. Let’s assume that the average customer
spends $15,000 a year.
Credit card interest revenue: Interest gets charged on a
credit card at a 20% per year interest rate. Let’s assume
that the average customer will get interest charged on
$2,000 of spending per year.
There are four different types of costs for credit cards
Credit card maintenance fee: It costs $10 a year to
maintain credit card services. This includes cost of
customer service, printing the credit card, replacing lost
credit cards, and keeping the credit card information in
the database.
Customer bankruptcies: Let’s assume that 5% of
customers can’t pay their credit card bills and that
Nigeria Card loses $10,000 on each of these customers
each year.
Cost to borrow funds: Let’s assume that it costs the credit
card company 1% annual interest rate to borrow the
money needed to fund the spend of customers. Let’s
assume that the average customer spends $15,000 a year,
and the credit card company pays 1% annual interest rate
113

on this.
Fixed costs: Let’s say that all of the fixed costs of the
company total $800M a year.
In addition, let’s project profits after the first year to increase 20%
per year due to the growth of the company.
In other words, the information above can be used to calculate the
profits during the first year. The second year’s profits can be
calculated by multiplying the first year’s profits by 1.2. The third
year’s profits can be calculated by multiplying the second year’s
profits by 1.2, and so on.
(Sample answer is on the following page)

114

Answer to Question 2: The math is straight forward, but there are a
lot of different parts to solving this problem. Let’s take this one step
at a time.
To calculate profit for the first year, we use the profit equation:
Profit = Revenue - Costs
Revenue:
Annual fee: $50 * 20M customers = $1B
Credit card transaction revenue: 3% * $15,000 * 20M
customers = $9B
Credit card interest revenue: 20% * $2,000 * 20M
customers = $8B
Total revenue = $18B
Costs:
Credit card maintenance fee: $10 * 20M customers =
$200M
Customer bankruptcies: 5% * 20M customers * $10,000 =
$10B
Cost to borrow funds: 1% * $15,000 * 20M customers =
$3B
Fixed costs: $800M
Total costs = $14B
Profit = $4B ($18B - $14B)
Therefore, the profit during the first year is $4B. We are given that
profits grow by 20% each year due to an increase in customers.
Year one profit: $4B
115

Year two profit: $4.8B
Year three profit: $5.76B
After three years, the total profit will be $14.56B. The goal was to
break even from the $14B in acquisition costs within three years.
Therefore, the goal is achievable, with Bank Co. expected to bring in
$560M in profit after the first three years.

116

Question 3: Instead of acquiring Nigeria Card, do you think Bank
Co. would be able to offer attractive credit cards to customers on
their own?
(Sample answer is on the following page)

117

Answer to Question 3: The answer could be either yes or no to this
question. What matters is whether the candidate provides a
reasonable, logical, and structured response. A sample response is
shown below.
I don’t think Bank Co. would be able to offer attractive credit cards
on their own for the following three reasons.
One, credit cards are a different type of offering than checking or
savings accounts. Credit cards have a tremendous amount of risk.
Credit cards are products for consumer spending, while checking
and savings accounts are products for consumer saving. For this
reason, Bank Co. will have to be able to handle all of the risks that
come with credit cards. When customers default on their credit card
accounts, companies can end up losing a lot of money. I don’t think
Bank Co. has the knowledge or expertise to handle this.
Two, there are substantial technologies and capabilities needed in
order to offer credit cards. There are complex database systems that
need to get set up on the backend. In addition, Bank Co. does not
have the other essential capabilities such as making the physical
credit cards, designing attractive credit card incentives, and offering
customer support for credit cards.
Third, Bank Co. will be missing a strong brand name in the credit
card market. People know Bank Co. as a checking and savings
account company, not as a credit card company.
For these three reasons, I think it would be very difficult for Bank
Co. to offer credit cards on their own.

118

Conclusion: Let’s say that the executive team of Bank Co. wants an
interim update on whether or not they should acquire Nigeria
Card. What do you say?
(Sample conclusion is on the following page)

119

Sample Conclusion: My working recommendation is that Bank Co.
should acquire Nigeria Card for the following four reasons:
One, there will be significant synergies between Bank Co. and
Nigeria Card if the acquisition were to happen. Revenue synergies
include cross-selling products and having access to new customer
bases. Cost synergies include consolidating headcount and
reducing overhead costs.
Two, we did a breakeven analysis and determined it would take
less than three years for Bank Co. to break even from the cost of
acquisition. This is aligned with management’s goals of breaking
even within three years.
Three, the top three competitors are all offering credit cards. This
suggests that Bank Co. should also offer credit cards if it does not
want to be left behind. The top three banks all offering credit cards
suggests that credit cards could be an essential part of the banking
business.
Four, an acquisition should be made instead of developing a credit
card offering organically in-house. This is because there are many
technologies and capabilities that Bank Co. needs in order to offer
attractive credit cards to customers. Examples include setting up a
backend database and managing risk. By itself, Bank Co. does not
have any of these.
For these four reasons, Bank Co. should acquire Nigeria Card.
For next steps, I would like to look into two things. One, I’d like to
analyze the credit card market closer to determine if it is an
attractive market. Two, I’d like to look more closely into Nigeria
Card’s financials and capabilities to understand if it is the most
attractive acquisition target.

120

Author Commentary: This case is a bit more challenging than
previous cases because it focuses and dives deeply into the credit
card industry. You may not understand how credit cards work or
be familiar with various terminology associated with the industry.
This case tests how well you can jump into a specific industry and
rationalize how the industry works.
For case interviews, interviewers do not expect candidates to have
background knowledge in industries or topics that their case is on.
Often times, interviewers will purposely choose an industry that
people generally don’t know or can’t relate to (e.g., timeshares, data
center equipment, waste disposal infrastructure). The important
thing is to make sure to ask questions whenever you do not
understand a term or a concept. The interviewer will not penalize
you for this, and will provide further explanation to help you
understand. Without understanding the terms and concepts
involved, you are facing an uphill battle for solving the case.

121

Practice Case #4 – The Price is Right
Difficulty: Moderate
Pharma Co. is a large US pharmaceutical corporation. They
research, develop, and manufacture drugs across a variety of
therapeutic areas. They have recently finished developing a drug to
treat arthritis.
Arthritis is a degenerative joint disease that affects the joints and
surrounding tissues. Common symptoms of this disease include
joint pain and stiffness, swelling, and decreased range of motion of
affected joints.
The company expects that the drug will get FDA approval soon,
and be ready for launch into the market. However, they are not
sure what price to set for the drug. The CFO has hired you to help
with this. What should the price of this new drug be?
(Sample framework is on the following page)

122

Sample Framework: One possible framework could look something
like the following. The candidate does not need to have this exact
framework, but should capture most of these points.
Customer willingness to pay
How much is the customer willing to pay for this
drug?
How much can the customer actually pay for the
drug?
How does medical/drug insurance factor into how
customers pay?
Competitor pricing
Do competitors also offer a drug to treat Arthritis?
How effective/safe is their drug?
How much do competitors price their drug?
Pharma Co.’s drug profitability
How much money has Pharma Co. invested in
researching and developing the drug?
How much money does it cost to produce the drug?
In how much time is Pharma Co. looking to break
even on the drug?
Other pricing strategies
What other pricing strategies does Pharma Co. want
to utilize?
Discounting for new customers
Bundling with other drugs
Subscription plan
How do these pricing strategies affect profit?

123

Question 1: In order to determine how to best price the drug, let’s
examine the competitors’ drugs for arthritis. The prices of their
drugs are shown below, and are plotted against efficacy and safety
risk.
Efficacy is how effective the drug is at reducing symptoms of
arthritis. High efficacy means the drug works well at reducing
symptoms and providing relief, while low efficacy means the drug
does not do much for the consumer.
Safety risk is how safe the drug is for the customer to take in terms
of minimal side effects and health implications. Low safety risk
means the drug has almost no side effects and does not damage the
consumer’s overall health. High safety risk means the drug has
serious side effects and may pose a threat for the consumer’s health.

(Sample answer is on the following page)

124

Answer to Question 1: The candidate should come to the conclusion
that Pharma Co.’s drug should be priced higher than $80.
Depending on their reasoning, they could also say that the drug
should be priced higher than $100.
To estimate the price of Pharma Co.’s drug, we need to look at the
competitor drugs’ efficacy, safety, and relative price. Generally,
drugs that have high efficacy and low safety risk will be the drugs
that are priced the highest. Let’s compare each of the competitors’
drugs to Pharma Co.’s drug.
Compared to Competitor A’s drug, Pharma Co.’s drug has both
higher efficacy and lower safety risk. Therefore, Pharma Co. has a
much better drug and it should be priced higher than Competitor
A’s drug that is priced at $50.
Compared to Competitor B’s drug, Pharma Co.’s drug has the same
efficacy, but a lower safety risk. Therefore, Pharma Co. has the
better drug and it should be priced higher than Competitor B’s
drug that is priced at $80.
Compared to Competitor C’s drug, Pharma Co.’s drug has the same
safety risk, and a higher efficacy. Therefore, Pharma Co. has the
better drug and it should be priced higher than Competitor C’s
drug that is priced at $60.
Finally, compared to Competitor D’s drug, Pharma Co.’s drug has a
lower efficacy, but a lower safety risk. Therefore, it is hard to say
whether the price of Pharma Co.’s drug should be higher or lower
than $100. It would depend on whether a customer would prefer
having a higher efficacy drug if that meant taking on a higher safety
risk.
We can look at the ratio of safety risk to efficacy. Ideally, we would
want a low ratio, which implies low safety risk and high efficacy.
Comparing Pharma. Co to Competitor D, Pharma Co. has a much
lower ratio of safety risk to efficacy. Therefore, one could make the
case that Pharma Co.’s drug is better, and should be priced higher
than Competitor D’s drug that is priced at $100.
125

126

Question 2: Given the information about efficacy and safety risk in
the previous question, how do you think Pharma Co. should
market or brand their drug? What differentiates it from the four
other drugs out there?
(Sample answer is on the following page)

127

Answer to Question 2: There are two possible answers to this
question.
The candidate could say that Pharma Co.’s drug has the lowest
safety risk in the market (tied with Competitor C). This could
appeal to customers who are looking to avoid having serious side
effects and health implications while relieving their arthritis
symptoms.
The candidate could also say that Pharma Co.’s drug has the
highest efficacy for the given amount of safety risk. In other words,
Pharma Co.’s drug has the best “value” since it offers the lowest
ratio of safety risk to efficacy. This could appeal to customers who
are looking for the maximum amount of efficacy for the given
amount of risk. This is analogous to the stock market, in which
many investors want the highest returns for the given amount of
risk.

128

Question 3: Next, let’s look at what price Pharma Co. should price
its drug at in order to break even from its investment within five
years.
Pharma Co. has invested $4B in this drug, and each drug costs
pennies to make. We can consider the costs of drug production to
be a negligible amount. We don’t know the number of customers in
the US market, so you will need to determine that through market
sizing. Assume that Pharma Co. will have a 20% market share of
the arthritis drug market once they launch their drug. Assume that
someone with arthritis will take the drug twice a year.
(Sample answer is on the following page)

129

Answer to Question 3: An example of a market sizing approach is
given below.
Structure for estimating the arthritis drug market size:
Start with the US population
Segment the US population by age
Estimate what percentage of each age group has arthritis
Estimate what percentage of people with arthritis will
take a drug vs. choose not to
Let’s assume that the US population is 320M people. Let’s divide
the US population into four different segments: (0-20), (20-40), (4060), and (60-80). Each segment has 80M people.
For (0-20), let’s assume 0% of the population has arthritis. You
typically develop arthritis as you get older, and this age segment is
far too young to have such a disease.
For (20-40), let’s also assume that 0% of the population has arthritis
for the same reason as before. This age segment is still too young to
have a significant prevalence of arthritis.
For (40-60), let’s assume 10% of people have arthritis. This is based
on personal experiences of hearing of aunts, uncles, and
grandparents that have arthritis. Therefore, there are $8M people
with arthritis in this segment. (10% * 80M)
For (60-80), let’s assume that 20% of people have arthritis. As
people get older, we’d expect more people to have the disease.
Therefore, there are 16M people with arthritis in this segment. (20%
* 80M)
Adding up the different age segments, we get 24M people with
arthritis. (8M + 16M)
Next, let’s assume that 75% of these people will take a drug to
130

reduce the symptoms of arthritis. The other 25% will choose not to
take a drug because of side effects or because they can tolerate their
symptoms without any drug.
From this, we get 18M potential customers that take an arthritis
drug.
Next, assuming we have a 20% market share, that brings the
number of our own customers down to 3.6M.
Finally, we can set up a breakeven equation to estimate what the
price of the drug should be to break even in 5 years.
The Breakeven Equation:
Quantity * (Price – Variable Costs) = Fixed Costs
We can calculate quantity first since we know the number of
customers, how often they take the drug, and how long we have to
break even
Quantity = 3.6M customers * 2 drugs a year * 5 years
Quantity = 36M units of drug
Variable Costs = $0 (each drug costs pennies to produce, which is
negligible)
Fixed Costs = $4B
Plugging these values into the equation:
36M * Price = $4B
Price = ~$111
The drug needs to be at least $111 in price in order for Pharma Co.
to break even within 5 years.

131

Question 4: We’ll move onto examining different customer
segments’ willingness to pay. Let’s say that there are three
segments of customers, each with a specific maximum that they are
willing to pay for the drug. For a given customer segment, if the
price of the drug is set above their maximum willingness to pay,
that customer segment will not purchase the drug at all. Let’s
assume that we can only set one price point for the drug, which is
the price all customers see and pay. We cannot price the drug
differently for different customer segments.
From the prior exercise, assume we have 3.6M customers and the
breakeven price was ~$110.
Given the information below, what price point should the drug be
set at?

132

(Sample answer is on the following page)

133

Answer to Question 4: There are three different price points we can
choose, $110, $200, or $500. If we set a price point above $500, no
customers will buy the product. It would not make sense to price
below $110, since all customers are willing to pay at least $110.
Similarly, for prices between $110-$200, and $200-$500, it does not
make sense to set a price in between those values since we can go
up to the next highest maximum willingness to pay price point and
get the same number of customers that will buy the drug.
If we set the price point at $110, all customers will purchase the
drug, giving us $792M/year.
(3.6M customers * 100% customers * 2 drugs a year * 1 year * $110 =
$792M/year)
If we set the price point at $200, customer segment 2 and customer
segment 3 will purchase the drug, giving us $720M/year.
(3.6M customers * 50% customers * 2 drugs a year * 1 year * $200 =
$720M/year)
If we set the price point at $500, only customer segment 3 will
purchase the drug, giving us $720M/year.
(3.6M customers * 20% customers * 2 drugs a year * 1 year * $500 =
$720M/year)
Therefore, it makes sense to price the drug at $110 in order to get all
customer segments to purchase the drug. This will create
$792M/year in revenue for Pharma Co.

134

Conclusion: Let’s say that the CFO wants a quick answer to how
much they should price their arthritis drug for. What would you
say?
(Sample conclusion is on the following page)

135

Sample Conclusion: I recommend that we price our arthritis drug at
$110 for the following three reasons:
One, we did a breakeven analysis and determined that if we price
the drug at $110, we will be able to break even in roughly 5 years.
This meets our company goal.
Two, examining the different customer segments and their
respective willingness to pay, we determined that $110 was the
price point that would maximize revenue. If we price any higher,
we lose customers, and revenues overall will decrease even though
price has gone up.
Three, our drug price should be higher than that of our competitors
because our drug has the highest efficacy for a given level of safety
risk. The most expensive competitor drug is $100, and we should be
able to price higher than that.
For these three reasons, $110 is the optimal price for the drug.
For next steps, I would like to look into two things. One, I’d like to
look into ways to set a different price for different customer
segments. This would allow us to further increase revenues. Two,
I’d like to look into other pricing strategies such as discounting for
new customers, bundling, or offering subscription pricing. These
strategies may also further increase revenues.

136

Author Commentary: Especially for final-round interviews, expect
to see various charts and figures with data. These can include: bar
charts, bubble charts, line graphs, Venn diagrams, scatter plots, and
flow charts. The interviewer will usually give you handouts with
the charts and figures on them, but some interviewers are moving
towards using interactive electronic tablets.
Make sure that you are familiar with all of the different ways that
data can be presented and be able to interpret and analyze various
charts and figures.
The “create your own bucket” was utilized for the last bucket in the
framework. For final-round interviews, expect to be given more
unusual business problems that require you to create one or two of
your own buckets to address the case objectives.

Practice Case #5 – Diamonds are Forever
Difficulty: Moderate
Our client is Diamond Co., a jewelry manufacturer that specializes
in making diamond jewelry. They are involved in all aspects of the
diamond jewelry value chain, from mining the diamonds to
manufacturing diamond rings, necklaces, and earrings.
Diamond Co. has recently experienced a decline in profitability
over the past few years. The CEO has hired you to determine what
is causing the decline in profitability. The CEO also wants
recommendations on what Diamond Co. should do about it?
(Sample framework is on the following page)

Question 1: Let’s look at diamond jewelry sales. Diamond Co. has
three product lines of jewelry: rings, necklaces, and earrings.
Looking at the information below, how much has the overall profit
margin for Diamond Co. declined by? What is causing the decline
in profit margin?

Answer to Question 1: The overall profit margin for Diamond Co. is
simply the weighted average of the profit margins for each product
by the percentage of sales.
We will first calculate the profit margin of each product. Profit
margin = Profit / Price
For example, looking at rings from the “Before” table:
Profit margin = ($2,300 - $1,150) / $2300 = $1,150 / $2300 = 50%
This is repeated for all of the other calculations, and can be
summarized in the table below.

Calculating the overall profit margin:
Before Profit Margin = (0.3 * 0.5) + (0.3 * 0.6) + (0.4 * 0.35)
Before Profit Margin = 47%
After Profit Margin = (0.4 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.6) + (0.4 * 0.25)
After Profit Margin = 42%
The overall profit margin for Diamond Co. has declined from 47%
to 42%. The decline in profit margin is caused by two things. First,
the profit margin for earrings has declined from 35% to 25%.
Second, Diamond Co. is now selling more rings, which have a
lower profit margin than necklaces, and selling fewer necklaces,
which have a higher profit margin than rings.

141

Question 2: What percentage of the decline in overall profitability is
caused by the shift of selling more rings and fewer necklaces? What
percentage of the decline in overall profitability is caused by the
decrease in profit margin for earrings?
(Sample answer is on the following page)

142

Answer to Question 2: We know that overall profit margins have
declined from 47% to 42%, a difference of 5%.
To calculate what percentage of the decline in profitability is caused
by the shift of selling more rings and fewer necklaces, we hold the
profitability of earrings to be constant. This is shown in the table
below, marked by a *.

After Profit Margin = 46%
Difference = 47% - 46% = 1%, which is 20% of the overall decline in
profitability (1%/5%)
Similarly for calculating what percentage of the decline in
profitability is caused by the decrease in profit margin for earrings,
we hold the percentage of sales of rings and necklaces constant.
This is shown in the table below, marked by a *.

Before Profit Margin = 47%
After Profit Margin = (0.3 * 0.5) + (0.3 * 0.6) + (0.4 * 0.25)
After Profit Margin = 43%
Difference = 47% - 43% = 4%, which is 80% of the overall decline in
profitability (4%/5%)
We previously calculated that profit margins declined from 47% to
42%, a difference of 5%. The shift of selling more rings and fewer
necklaces accounted for 20% of this overall decline. The decrease in
profit margin for earrings accounted for 80% of this overall decline.

Question 3: Let’s look at why we are selling fewer necklaces. The
table below shows information about the necklace prices for
Diamond Co. vs. the other competitors.
What insights can you draw from this table as to why Diamond Co.
is selling fewer necklaces? What should Diamond Co. do to solve
this?

Competitor F

(Sample answer is on the following page)

145

Answer to Question 3: Looking at the table, there are two distinct
price groups.
Competitor A, C, and E seem to sell high-end necklaces at a price
point of $11,000, $20,000, and $17,000. Competitors B, D, and F seem
to sell low-end necklaces at a price point of $600, $300, and $500.
Diamond Co. lies in the middle of this price spectrum, at $1,700.
Diamond Co. is getting squeezed out of the diamond necklace
market. There are two distinct price ranges that customers seem to
purchase from. The “high-end” range from $11,000 - $20,000 or the
“low-end” range from $300 - $600. Customers do not seem to want
to purchase a “mid-range” diamond necklace that lies in between
these two.
To solve this, Diamond Co. should change the price of its diamond
necklaces to fall into one of these two ranges. We know that their
necklace costs $680 to produce. Because of this, Diamond Co.
should not sell in the “low-end” of the market because that price
range is $300 - $600, and Diamond Co. will not be profitable.
Therefore, Diamond Co. should price its diamond necklace higher,
closer to the $11,000 - $ 20,000 range. This may increase quantity of
necklaces sold, while also significantly improving profit margins.

146

Question 4: Looking at the information we have on earrings, what
can you conclude about why its profit margin has decreased? What
are some ways to improve its profit margin?
(Sample answer is on the following page)

147

Answer to Question 4: Profit margins for earrings have declined
because costs have increased at a faster rate than price has
increased. We can improve profit margins by increasing price or
decreasing costs.
Increase Price
Invest more in marketing the earrings as an ultrapremium product to justify a higher price
Offer limited edition earrings in order to artificially
decrease supply, which may increase the market
price
Redesign the earring into a new style to sell at a
higher price
Decrease Costs
Decrease variable costs
Renegotiate purchasing price for raw materials
used to make earrings (e.g. the silver, gold, or
other metal that is part of the earring)
Use a smaller quantity of diamonds to
manufacture the earrings
Use lower quality diamonds in the earrings
Decrease fixed costs
Invest in new equipment or technology that is
more cost efficient to mine diamonds and
produce earrings
Renegotiate distributor or retailer contracts
Renegotiate salaries
A common mistake that occurs among candidates is confusing
profit with profitability.

148

Conclusion: The CEO wants a quick answer to why profitability has
declined and what the company should do about it. What do you
say?
(Sample conclusion is on the following page)

149

Sample Conclusion: Diamond Co. is experiencing a decline in
profitability for two reasons: 1) profit margins for earrings have
declined from 35% to 25%, and 2) Diamond Co. is selling more
rings, which have a lower profit margin than necklaces, and fewer
necklaces. The first reason is responsible for 80% of the decline in
profitability.
To address this, I recommend the following two actions.
One, Diamond Co. should increase the price that it sells its
necklaces for. We are being squeezed out of this market because
most competitors sell their necklaces at either a “low-end” or “highend” price range. Our company prices necklaces in between these
two ranges, and customers seem to want either a cheap necklace or
a very expensive necklace. They do not want necklaces that fall in
between.
Two, Diamond Co. can work on improving profitability on their
earrings. They can do this by either increasing price or decreasing
costs. Diamond Co. can increase price through offering limited
edition earrings, redesigning the earring look or style, or investing
in marketing the earrings as an ultra-premium product. They can
decrease costs by reducing fixed costs and/or variable costs. Fixed
costs can be reduced by investing in more efficient technology to
mine diamonds and produce earrings or by renegotiating salaries
or contracts. Variable costs can be reduced by using a smaller
quantity or lower quality of diamonds for their earrings.
For next steps, I would like to look into the following two things.
One, I’d look into what price necklaces should be set at to maximize
profits. Two, I’d look into how to improve profitability of rings,
which we have not looked into yet.

Author Commentary: For this case, the math calculation for
Question 2 is on the more difficult side. Whenever you get a
complex math problem, it is important to try to break it down into
smaller pieces of calculations so that you don’t get lost in the
numbers. Question 2 basically asks for two different drivers, what
percentage of decline in profits is caused by each
We can break down this calculation in the following way:
Determine the overall decline in profitability if both
drivers occur (this was answered in Question 1)
Determine the decline in profitability if only Driver 1
occurs
Divide the decline in profitability if only Driver 1 occurs
by the overall decline in profitability (this is the
percentage of profitability decline caused by Driver 1)
Subtract the previous answer from 100% to determine the
decline in profitability caused by Driver 2 (Driver 1 +
Driver 2 must be responsible for 100% of the decline in
profitability)
Alternatively, we can repeat the first three bullets for
Driver 2
Another common mistake candidates make is confusing profit with
profitability/profit margin. If you’re not sure which of these
metrics have declined, make sure to ask the interviewer. These two
metrics can lead the case in completely different directions.
Remember that:
Profit = Revenue ($) – Costs ($)
Profit Margin = Profit ($) / Revenue ($)

Final Thoughts
You now know exactly what to expect during the case interview.
You know what interviewers are looking for, and what to do and
say for each part of the case interview. You know the single
framework that you need to memorize in order to efficiently
develop unique and effective frameworks for every case. You have
practiced and sharpened up your basic math skills while learning or
reviewing basic business knowledge.
There is more learning to be done. I’d recommend getting with
your case interview partner and practicing as many cases as you
have the time for. Every case that you do makes you a stronger,
more competitive candidate and gets you closer to your dream job
offer. Interviewing for consulting firms is a very competitive
process, and you want to do as many case interviews as you can to
put yourself in the best position to succeed.
While preparing for case interviews can take a significant amount
of time, if consulting is truly the job that you want, the time
invested is worth it. What separates a candidate that gets multiple
consulting job offers from one who doesn’t get any is the amount of
time invested. You need to invest the time and have the discipline
to follow through.
Case interviews can actually be quite fun. You get to solve
interesting and complex business problems in under an hour. If you
feel yourself enjoying doing practice cases, then that is a good sign
that you will have a great time with consulting as your profession.
I wish you the best of luck.
